<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="pn p2">The degree in which any social system has succeeded
in ascertaining woman's proper position, and in
putting her into it, will be a very accurate test of the
progress it has made in civilisation. And the very
general and growing conviction, that our own social
arrangements, as they exist at present, have not
attained any satisfactory measure of success in this
respect, would seem, therefore, to indicate, that
England in her nineteenth century has not yet reached
years of discretion after all.</p>

<p>But conscious deficiency is with nations at least, if
not always with individuals, the sure precursor of
improvement. The path before us towards the ideal
in this matter is a very long one; extends, indeed,
further than eye can see. What path of progress does
not? And our advance upon it will still be a sure
concomitant and proof of our advance in all civilisation.
But the question of more immediate moment is,
admitting that we are moving in this respect, are we
moving in the right direction? We have been <i>moving</i>
for a long time back. Have we missed the right
road? Have we unfortunately retrograded instead of
progressing?</p>

<p>There are persons who think so. And there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
not wanting, in the great storehouse of history, certain
periods, certain individuals, certain manifestations of
social life, to which such persons point as countenancing
the notion, that better things have been, as
regards woman's position and possibilities, than are
now. There are, painted on the slides of Mnemosyne's
magic lanthorn, certain brilliant and captivating figures,
which are apt to lead those who are disgusted with the
smoke and reek of the Ph&oelig;nix-burning going on around
them, to suppose that the social conditions which produced
such, must have been less far from the true path
than our present selves. Nay, more. There have been
constellations of such stars, quite sufficiently numerous
to justify the conclusion, that the circumstances of the
time at which they appeared were in their nature calculated
to produce them.</p>

<p>Of such times, the most striking in this respect, as in
so many others, is that fascinating dawn time of
modern life, that ever wonderful "rénaissance" season,
when a fresh sap seemed to rush through the tissues
of the European social systems, as they passed from
their long winter into spring. And in the old motherland
of European civilisation, where the new life was
first and most vehemently felt,&mdash;in Italy, the most
remarkable constellations of these attractive figures
were produced.</p>

<p>The women of Italy, at that period remarkable in
different walks, and rich in various high gifts, form in
truth a very notable phenomenon; and one sufficiently
prevalent to justify the belief, that the general circumstances
of that society favoured the production of such.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
But the question remains, whether these brilliant types
of womanhood, attractive as they are as subjects of
study, curiously illustrative as they are of the social
history of the times in which they lived, are on the
whole such as should lead us to conclude, that the true
path of progress would be found to lead towards social
conditions that should be likely to reproduce them?</p>

<p>Supposing it to be asserted, that they were not so
necessarily connected in the relationship of cause and
effect with the whole social condition of the times in
which they lived, as that any attempt to resuscitate
such types need involve a reproduction of their social
environment; even then the question would remain,
whether, if it were really possible to take them as
single figures out of the landscape in which they
properly stand, they would be such as we should find
it desirable to adopt as models of womanhood? Are
these such as are wanted to be put in the van of our
march&mdash;in the first ranks of nineteenth century civilisation?
Not whether they are good to put in niches to
be admired and cited for this or that virtue or capacity;
nor even whether they might be deemed desirable
captains in a woman's march towards higher destinies
and better conditioned civilisation, if, indeed, such a
progress were in any sane manner conceivable; but
whether such women would work harmoniously and
efficiently with all the other forces at our command
for the advancement of a civilisation, of which the
absolute <i>sine quâ non</i> must be the increased solidarity,
co-operation, and mutual influence of both the sexes?</p>

<p>It may be guessed, perhaps, from the tone of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
above sentences, that the writer is not one of those who
think that the past can in this matter be made useful
to us, as affording ready-made models for imitation.
But he has no intention of dogmatising, or even indulging
in speculations on "the woman's question."
On the contrary, in endeavouring to set before the
reader his little cabinet of types of womanhood, he has
abstained from all attempt at pointing any moral of the
sort. The wish to do so is too dangerously apt to lead
one to assimilate one's portrait less carefully to the
original than to a pattern figure conceived for the
purpose of illustrating a theory. Whatever conclusions
on the subject of woman's destiny, proper position, and
means of development are to be drawn, therefore, from
the consideration of the very varied and certainly remarkable
types set before him, the reader must draw
for himself. It has been the writer's object to show
his portraits, more or less fully delineated according to
their interest, and in some measure according to the
abundance or the reverse of available material, in their
proper setting of social environment. They have been
selected, not so much with any intention of bringing
together the best, greatest, or most admirable, nor
even the most remarkable women Italy has produced,
as with a view of securing the greatest amount of
variety, in point of social position and character. Each
figure of the small gallery will, it is hoped, be found to
illustrate a distinct phase of Italian social life and
civilisation.</p>

<p>The canonised Saint, that most extraordinary product
of the "ages of faith," highly interesting as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
social, and perhaps more so still as a psychological
phenomenon;&mdash;the feudal Châtelaine, one of the most
remarkable results of the feudal system, and affording
a suggestive study of woman in man's place;&mdash;the high-born
and highly-educated Princess of a somewhat less
rude day, whose inmost spiritual nature was so profoundly
and injuriously modified by her social position;&mdash;the
brilliant literary denizen of "La Bohème;"&mdash;the
equally brilliant but large-hearted and high-minded
daughter of the people, whose literary intimacies were
made compatible with the strictest feminine propriety,
and whom no princely connections, lay and ecclesiastical,
prevented from daring to think and to speak
her thought, and to meet with brave heart the consequences
of so doing;&mdash;the popular actress, again a
daughter of the people, and again in that, as is said,
perilous walk in life, a model of correct conduct in the
midst of loose-lived princesses;&mdash;the nobly-born adventuress,
every step in whose extraordinary <i>excelsior</i> progress
was an advance in degradation and infamy, and
whose history, in showing us court life behind the scenes,
brings us among the worst company of any that the
reader's varied journey will call upon him to fall in with;&mdash;the
equally nobly-born, and almost equally worthless
woman, who shows us that wonderful and instructive
phenomenon, the Queen of a papal court;&mdash;the humbly
born artist, admirable for her successful combination
in perfect compatibility of all the duties of the home
and the studio;&mdash;and lastly, the poor representative of
the effeteness of that social system which had produced
the foregoing types, the net result, as may be said, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
the national passage through the various phases illustrated
by them:&mdash;all these are curiously distinct manifestations
of womanhood, and if any measure of success
has been attained in the endeavour to represent them
duly surrounded by the social environment which produced
them, while they helped to fashion it, some
contribution will have been made to a right understanding
of woman's nature, and of the true road
towards her more completely satisfactory social development.</p>

<p class="pn p2">There are not many chapters of history more
extraordinary and more perplexing than that which
relates the story of St. Catherine. Very perplexing it
will be found by any, who may think it worth while to
examine the record;&mdash;which is indeed well worthy of
examination, not only as illustrative of one of the most
obscure phases of human nature, but also as involving
some highly interesting questions respecting the value
of historic evidence.</p>

<p>Of such examination it has received but little.
Among Catholics the "legend" of the Saint is to this
day extensively used for such purposes as similar
legends were intended to serve. Orthodox teachers
have used the story unsparingly as stimulus, example,
and testimony. But orthodox historians have passed
over it with the lightest tread and most hurried step;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
while such Protestant readers as may have chanced to
stray into the dim, despised wilderness of Romish
hagiography, have in all probability very quickly tossed
the volume aside, compendiously classing its subject in
their minds with other dark-aged lumber of martyrs,
who walked with their heads in their hands, and saints
who personally maltreated the enemy of mankind.</p>

<p>Yet a very little consideration of the story will show,
that it cannot with fairness be thus summarily disposed
of. After seeing large solid masses of monastic romance
and pious falsehood evaporate from the crucible of our
criticism, there will be still found a very considerable
residuum of strangely irreducible fact of the most
puzzling description.</p>

<p>It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that the
phenomena to be examined are not the product of the
dark night-time of history, so favourable to the generation
of saints and saintly wonders. Cock-crow was
near at hand when Catherine walked the earth. The
grandsons of her contemporaries had the printing-press
among them; and the story of her life was printed at
Florence in the ninety-seventh year after her death.
While the illiterate Sienese dyer's daughter was working
miracles, moral and physical, Petrarch and Boccaccio
were still writing, and Dante had recently written.
Giotto had painted the panels we still gaze on, and
Niccolò of Pisa carved the stones we yet handle.
Chroniclers and historians abounded; and the scene
of the strange things recorded by them was at that
time one of the centres of human civilisation and
progress. We are there in no misty debateable land
of myth and legendary song; but walk among familiar
facts of solid well-authenticated history, studied for its
lessons by statesmen, and accepted as the basis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
theories by political philosophers. And yet, in the
midst of these indubitable facts, mixed with them,
acting on them, undeniably influencing them, we come
upon the records of a story wild as any tale of Denis
or Dunstan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIENA.</div>

<p>When once launched on the strange narrative, as it
has come down to us, it is somewhat difficult to
remember steadily how near we are all along to the
solid shore of indisputable fact. Holding fast to this,
therefore, as long as may be, we will approach the
subject by endeavouring to obtain some idea of the
material aspect of the "locus in quo."</p>

<p>No one perhaps of the more important cities of
Italy retains the visible impress of its old republican
medieval life to so remarkable a degree as Siena.
Less favoured by fortune than her old enemy, and
present ruler, Florence, she has been less benefited or
injured by the activity and changes of modern days.
And the city retains the fossilised form and shape
which belonged to it at the time when its own stormy
old life was finally crushed out of it. The once
turbulent, energetic, and brave old city, sits there still,
on the cold bleak top of a long spent volcano&mdash;emblem
meet enough of her own nature and fortunes&mdash;grim,
silent, stern, in death. The dark massy stone fronts,
grand and gloomy, of old houses, built to defy all the
vicissitudes of civic broils, and partisan town-fighting,
still frown over narrow streets, no longer animated by
the turbulent tide of life which filled them during the
centuries of the city's independence.</p>

<p>The strange old "piazza," once the pulsating heart,
whence the hot tide of the old civic life flowed through
all the body of the little state, still occupies its singular
position in the hollow of what was in some remote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
ante-Etruscan time, the crater of a volcano. Tall
houses of five or six stories stand in a semicircle
around this peculiar shell-shaped cup, while the chord
of the arc they form, is furnished by the picturesque
"palazzo pubblico," with its tall slender tower of dark
brick, and quaintly painted walls. Like the lava tide,
which at some distant period of the world's history
flowed hence down the scored sides of the mountain,
the little less boiling tide of republican war and
republican commerce, which Siena was wont to pour
out from the same fount, is now extinct and spent.
But such lazy, stagnant, unwholesome life as despotism
and priestcraft have left to Siena, is still most alive in
and around the old piazza.</p>

<p>Up the sides of this doubly extinguished crater, and
down the exterior flanks of the mountain, run steep,
narrow, tortuous and gloomy, the flagstone-paved
streets of the old city. So steep are they in some
parts, that stairs have to take the place of the sloping
flagstones, which are often laid at such an angle of
declivity as to render wheel-traffic impossible. On
the highest pinnacle of the rim, overlooking the
hollow of the once crater, stands the Cathedral, on
such uneven ground, that its east end is supported by
a lofty baptistery, built underneath it on the rapid
descent. In the most ornamented style of Italian-gothic
architecture, and picturesque, though quaint, in
its parti-coloured livery of horizontal black and white
stripes in alternate courses of marble, the old church
still contains a wonderful quantity of medieval Sienese
art in many kinds. Carving in wood and in stone,
painting in fresco and in oil, inlaid work and mosaic,
richly coloured windows and gilded cornices, adorn
walls, floor, and roof, in every part. The whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
history of art from the early days, when Sienese artists
first timidly essayed to imitate barbaric Byzantine
models, to its perfect consummation in those glorious
ages which immediately preceded the downfall of
Italian liberty, is set forth in this fine old church,
as in a rich and overflowing museum. Some half
dozen popes sleep beneath sculptured tons of monumental
marble in different parts of it,&mdash;among them
two of the very old Sienese family of Picolomini.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FONTEBRANDA.</div>

<p>On another peak, or spur, of the deeply seamed
mountain, stands the huge unornamented brick church
and monastery of St. Dominic, so situated, that
between it and the Cathedral is a steep gorge, the
almost precipitous sides of which the old city has
covered with stair-like streets. Deep at the bottom of
this gorge, near a gate in the city wall, which runs
indefatigably up and down the mountain ridges and
ravines in its circuit around the spacious city, now a
world too wide for its shrunken population, is that old
fountain, which one passing word of the great poet has
made for ever celebrated. Here is still that Fontebranda,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
which, with all its wealth of sparkling water,
the thirst-tormented coiner in the thirtieth canto of
the Inferno, less longs for than he does to see in
torment with him those who had tempted him to the
deed he was expiating.</p>

<p>The Dantescan pilgrim, who, among his first objects
at Siena, runs to visit this precious fountain, finds, not
without a feeling of disappointment, a square mass of
heavy ugly brickwork, supported on some three or four
unornamented arches on each of its four sides. Within
is a large tank, also of brick, the sides of which rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
about two feet above the level of the soil; and this is
perennially filled by a cool and pure spring from the
sandstone side of the mountain, which there rises in a
broken cliff immediately behind the ungraceful, though
classic building. Descending the steep street in search
of this poet-hallowed spot, with the Cathedral behind
him, and St. Dominic's church high on its peak above
and in front of him, the visitor finds that he is passing
through a part of the city inhabited by the poorer
classes of its people. And near the bottom of the hill,
and around the fountain itself, it is manifest to more
senses than one, that a colony of tanners and dyers is
still established on the same site which their forefathers
occupied, when Giacomo Benincasa was one of
the guild.</p>

<p>The general aspect of this remote and low-lying
corner of the city is squalid and repulsive. Eyes and
nose are alike offended by all around them. And the
stranger, who has been attracted thither by the well-remembered
name of "Fontebranda," hastens to reclimb
his way to the upper part of the town; probably
unconscious, perhaps uncaring, that within a few
yards of him lies another object of pilgrimage, classic
after another fashion, and hallowed to the feelings of a
far more numerous body of devotees. For a little way
up the hill, on the left hand side of the poverty-stricken
street, as one goes upwards, among the miserable and
filthy-looking skin-dressers' houses, is still to be seen
that of Giacomo Benincasa, in which his daughter
Catherine, the future Saint, was born, in the year
1347, and lived dining the greater portion of her short
career.</p>

centuries which followed her death, has not permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the dwelling to remain altogether as it was when she
inhabited it. The street front has been sufficiently
altered to indicate to any passenger, that it belongs to
some building of more note than the poor houses
around it. Two stories of a "loggia," or arcade, of
dark brick, supported on little marble columns,&mdash;four
arches above, and four below,&mdash;run along the front of
the upper part of the building. On the ground-floor,
a large portal, like that of a chapel, such as in fact now
occupies the entire basement story, sufficiently shows
that the building within is no longer a poor dyer's
habitation. On the side is a smaller door opening on
a handsome straight stone staircase, eight feet wide.
By this entrance visitors are admitted to gratify for an
equal fee their Catholic devotion or heretic curiosity.</p>

<p>The whole lower floor of the house, once, as tradition,
doubtless correctly, declares, the dyer's workshop
(as similar portions of the neighbouring houses
are still the workshops of modern dyers), is now a
chapel. "Virginea Domus," is conspicuously carved
in stone above the portal, somewhat unfairly ignoring
the existence of poor Giacomo in his own workshop.
The walls are covered with frescoes by Salimbeni and
Pachierotti, and a picture by Sodoma adorns the altar.
Ascending the handsome flight of stone stairs, the
visitor finds most of the space on the first floor
occupied by another chapel. This was the living
room of the family, and is nearly as large as the workshop
below. But at the end of it, farthest from the
street, and therefore from the light also, there is a
little dark closet, nine feet long by six wide. It is
entered from the larger room by a very low door, cut
in a very thick wall, and has no other means of
receiving light or air. This was Catherine's bedchamber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
The pavement of the little closet is of
brick, and on this, with a stone&mdash;still extant <i>in situ</i>&mdash;for
a pillow, the future Saint slept. The bricks,
sanctified by this nightly contact with her person,
have been boarded over to preserve them from the
wear and tear of time, and from the indiscreet pilfering
of devout relic-hunters.</p>

<p>Various treasures of this sort, such as the lamp she
used to carry abroad, the handle of her staff, &amp;c., are
preserved on the altar of the adjoining chapel: and
one or more other oratories have been built and ornamented
in and about the Saint's dwelling-place. But
the only spot which has any interest for a heretical
visitor is the little dark and dismal hole&mdash;Catherine's
own chamber and oratory&mdash;the scene of the young
girl's nightly vigils, lonely prayers, spiritual struggles,
and monstrous self-inflictions.</p>

<p>"Surely," cries the pious pilgrim, "as holily penetential
a cell, as ever agonized <i>De profundis</i> rose from
to the throne of Grace!"</p>

<p>"Truly," remarks the philosophic visitor, "a dormitory
well calculated, in all its conditions, to foster and
develop every morbid tendency of mind or body in its
occupant!"</p>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">THE SAINT'S BIOGRAPHER.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">A great number of devout writers have occupied
their pens on "legends" and biographies of St.
Catherine, more or less complete in their scope and
pretensions. The public library at Siena contains no
less than seventy-nine works, of which the popular
Saint of the city is the subject. Almost all of them,
however, seem to be based more or less directly and
avowedly on the work of "the Blessed" Raymond of
Capua.</p>

<p>Perhaps some heretic's untutored mind may be so
ignorant as not to know that the adjective joined to
Raymond in the preceding sentence is not only an
epithet, but a title. "Beatification," is a spiritual
grade inferior to "sanctification," conferred by the
same unerring authority, and implying different and
inferior privileges and position.</p>

<p>Childish trash enough it seems. Yet may not
possibly some disciple of that modern school of
moralists, which teaches that happiness is not, or
should not be man's highest and ultimate aim, see in
this assertion of the superiority of "sanctification" to
"blessedness," one of the many instances in which
Rome's pettifogging formalism and unspiritual materialism
have fossilised a lofty thought into a low
absurdity?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Be this as it may, Raymond of Capua was never in
Rome's hierarchy "more than blessed."</p>

<p>This "Beato Raimondo" was "in the world"
Raimondo delle Vigne, great-grandson of Pietro delle
Vigne, the celebrated Chancellor of the Emperor
Frederick II., who right royally rewarded his life-long
services by putting his eyes out. Raymond
his great-grandson was a Dominican monk; and
became<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> twenty-fourth general of the order, in 1578,
at the time when a schism in the Church, divided
between two popes, produced a corresponding schism
in all the monastic orders. Raymond governed that
portion of the Dominican fraternity which recognised
the Pope, subsequently acknowledged by the Church
as the true one.</p>

<p>Having been sent, in 1367, to preside over the
Dominican convent in Siena, he was there by divine<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
intervention, say the learned historians of the literature
of the order, appointed confessor and confidant to
St. Catherine. The superior sanctity of the penitent
was however soon made manifest. For when Siena
was ravaged by a pestilence, in 1372, and Prior
Raymond having caught it, while ministering to the
sick, lay dying, he was miraculously restored to health
by the prayers of St. Catherine.</p>

<p>The General of the Dominicans, as he shortly
afterwards became, was a man of mark, moreover,
beyond the limits of his own Society; for he was
employed on several missions and negotiations by the
Pope. With such qualifications and opportunities, he
certainly would seem to have been the most competent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
person imaginable to give the world an account of his
saintly penitent's career. This he has done in a work
often reprinted, and most recently at Milan, in two
good-sized octavo volumes, in 1851. The "Life of
Saint Catherine of Siena, the Seraphic spouse of Jesus
Christ" forms volumes nine and ten of an "Ecclesiastical
Library," brought out at a very cheap rate,
as a means of supplying the people of Italy in the
nineteenth century with wholesome and profitable
mental food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPULAR LITERATURE.</div>

<p>A glance at the nature and quality of this work is
desirable for several reasons. In the first place, it
is necessary to ascertain how far we can implicitly
rely on its statements of matters of fact respecting
Catherine's history. In the second place, a knowledge
of the mental calibre and intellectual standing of the
Saint's confessor, confidant, and friend, cannot but
assist us in estimating her own character. And lastly,
it is no little interesting to observe what spiritual and
intellectual provender is provided in these days for the
population of Italy by those who have the education
and guidance of her people in their hands.</p>

<p>This widely circulated work is an Italian translation
from the original Latin of Father Raymond, executed
by Bernardino Pecci, Bishop of Grosseto. In the notice
of St. Catherine, in the "Biographie Universelle," it
is stated, among a singularly large number of other<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
errors, that Raymond translated into Latin the Life of
the Saint from the Italian of Fra Tommaso della
Fonte, who preceded him in his office of confessor,
making some additions to the original text. But a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
very cursory examination of the book would have
sufficed to show the French writer that, although
Father Raymond frequently cites Fra Tommaso as the
authority for some of his statements, the entire composition
is wholly the work of the former.</p>

<p>An equally short glance at this "Life" will also
suffice to convince any one in search of the facts of the
Saint's career, that little assistance is to be got from
Father Raymond. It is indeed very evident, that the
author did not write with any intention of furnishing
such. He rarely gives any dates, and scarcely makes
any pretence of observing chronological order. He
says, that he writes in his own old age, long after the
events occurred; owns that he forgets much; and,
though carefully and ostentatiously winding up every
chapter with a reference to his authorities for the
statements contained in it, is yet avowedly throwing
together a mass of anecdotical recollections, as they
occur to him. He rarely, if ever, records any unmiraculous
and unsaintly doings;&mdash;mentions, for instance,
that she performed such and such miracles at Pisa,
or discoursed in such and such terms at Genoa; but
does not give the slightest hint why she went thither,
or when. In short, the whole scope and object of the
book is devotional, and in no degree historic. It is
written for the promotion of piety, and especially for
the glory of the Order of St. Dominic, and of the
Dominican St. Catherine. The wonders related are
evidently intended to cap other wonders. They constantly
consist of performances essentially similar to
those recorded of older saints, but enhanced by some
added circumstance of extra impossibility. And the
writer, in his competitive eagerness, often pauses in
his narration to point out, that no former recorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
miracles have come up to that he is relating in outrageousness
of contradiction to the laws of nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FATHER RAYMOND'S WORK.</div>

<p>Were it not, however, for these and such like
evidences of the <i>animus</i> of the writer, and were it not
also, it must be added, for the exceeding difficulty of
supposing that an undoubtedly distinguished man, a
contemporary of Petrarch and Boccaccio, could have
believed the monstrous impossibilities he relates as
facts,&mdash;the tone of the book would seem to be that of
sincerity. In a subsequent chapter, the reader will
have an opportunity of examining some specimens of
these extraordinary relations. For the present, as a
taste of the quality of this remarkable book, <i>reprinted
in 1851 for wide circulation among the readers of Italy</i>,
and as a means of judging how far it is possible to
credit the writer with simple-hearted sincerity, he may
take the following passages from a long prologue of
thirty pages, which the learned author opens with a
quotation from the Apocalypse, "I saw an angel
descending from Heaven, having the key of the Abyss
and a great chain in his hand;"&mdash;and in which
he points out the application of these words to
St. Catherine. Having shown at much length that
she may well be considered an angel descending from
Heaven, he proceeds thus:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"Finally we find added to the words of St. John,
which have been taken as a foundation for this prologue,
the following phrase: '<i>Et catenam magnam
habens in manu suâ</i>;' which, like those that precede
them, adapt themselves to our subject, and explain the
significance of her name. What wonder is it, that
Catherine should have a chain,&mdash;<i>catena?</i> Is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
then no agreement in the sound of the two words?
Since if you pronounce 'Caterina' with a syncope,
you have 'Catena;' and if to 'Catena' you join a
syllable, you have the name of 'Caterina.' Shall we
attach ourselves then to words and appearances only,
neglecting the things and the mysteries signified by
these words? Not only the words, but also the things
themselves point out to us the applicability. Since
<i>catha</i> in the Greek tongue signifies that which in the
Latin is <i>universe</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Hence also the Catholic Church
is from the force of the Greek word properly called
in Latin Universal. Caterina therefore and Catena
signify in our tongue University; which thing also a
chain&mdash;<i>catena</i>&mdash;manifests in its very nature."</p>

<p>After many pages of such extraordinary nonsense,
he arrives at the conclusion, that Caterina certainly
means Universality, and that in this name, made
Catena by syncope, "lies hidden perhaps no small
mystery!"</p>

<p>It does seem wholly incredible, that this should be
the best product of the mind of one, chosen out to
be the foremost of the Dominicans of his day, and
selected by the Pope to be entrusted with important
missions. It is difficult not to suspect, that this great-grandson
of Frederick II.'s famous Chancellor was a
very different man, when subtly diplomatising in
Rome's interest with courts and princes, or when
considering in council the interests of his order, from
what he shows himself when addressing the people.
Surely the <i>Concio ad Populum</i> must have differed from
the <i>Concio ad Clerum</i> as widely as any sect's esoteric
ever did from its exoteric doctrines. And the "no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
small mystery of Caterina cut down by syncope to
Catena," was, we may well believe, not the subject of
very serious meditations behind the screen on the
priestly side of the altar. Is it indeed possible to
abstain from the conviction, that we have detected the
reverend figure of Father Raymond of Capua, General
of the Dominicans, very decidedly laughing in his
sleeve at that poor ill-used people, to whose proneness
to be deceived, Rome has ever answered with so ready
and so hearty a <i>decipiatur?</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">POPULUS VULT DECIPI; DECIPIATUR.</div>

<p>One other specimen of the quality of this Dominican
monk's work may not be superfluous in enabling the
reader to make up his mind respecting him and his
teaching.</p>

<p>He tells us<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> that Catherine, when in her seventh
year, retired one day into some corner of the house,
where she could not be seen or overheard, and thus
prayed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O most blessed and holy Virgin, first among
women to consecrate by a perpetual vow thy virginity
to the Lord, by whom thou wast graciously made
mother of His only begotten son, I pray of thy ineffable
goodness, that without considering my merits or my
weakness, thou wouldst be pleased to do me the great
favour<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of giving me for husband Him, whom I desire
with all the passion of my soul, thy most Holy Son,
our only Lord Jesus Christ; and I promise to Him
and to thee, that I will never receive any other
husband, and that with all my power I will preserve
for Him my purity ever unblemished."</p>

<p>"Do you perceive, O reader!" continues the
biographer, "with what order all the graces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
virtuous operations of this Holy Virgin are powerfully
and sweetly regulated by that Wisdom which disposes
all things? In the <i>sixth</i> year of her age, while yet
seeing her spouse with the eyes of the body, she
gloriously received his benediction. In the <i>seventh</i>
year, she made the vow of chastity. The first of these
numbers is superior to all others in perfection: and
the latter is called by all theologians, the number of
Universality. What then can be understood from this,
if not that this Virgin was destined to receive from
the Lord the <i>Universal Perfection</i> of all the virtues;
and consequently to possess a perfect degree of glory?
Since the first number signifies Perfection, and the
second Universality, what can they signify, when put
together, other than Universal Perfection? Wherefore
she was properly called Catherine,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which signifies, as
has been shown, Universality."</p>

<p>This, and some three or four hundred closely printed
pages of similar material, has recently (1851) been
published at a price, which only a very large circulation
could make possible. "And yet," cry the priests and
priest-ridden rulers of the nations for whom this
spiritual food is provided, "we are accused of keeping
our people in ignorance, and discouraging reading!
On the contrary, we carefully teach our flocks, and
seek but to provide them wholesome instead of
poisonous mental food. Here is reading, calculated
to make men good Christians, good subjects&mdash;and to
keep them quiet."</p>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">THE FACTS OF THE CASE.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Little reliable information as to the real unmiraculous
events of Catherine Benincasa's life is to be
obtained, as has been seen, from the pages of her
professed biographer. But there is another pietistic
work, forming part of the same "Ecclesiastical
Library," in which Father Raymond's book has been
recently reprinted, that offers somewhat better gleanings
to the inquirer into the facts of the case. This
is a reprint in four volumes (Milan, 1843–4) of the
Saint's Letters, with the annotations of the Jesuit,
Father Frederick Burlamacchi. These letters had
been already several times published, when the learned
Lucchese Jesuit undertook to edit them in the beginning
of the eighteenth century. The former editions
were imperfect, incorrect, and uncommented. But
the Jesuit, jesuitlike, has done his work well; and his
notes, appended to the end of each letter, contain
abundant information respecting the persons to whom
they are addressed, the events and people alluded to in
them, and, wherever attainable, the dates at which
they were written. To the labours therefore of Father
Burlamacchi is due most of the information thrown
together in the following concise account of Catherine's
career; in which it is intended, leaving aside saintship
and miracles for a moment, to give the reader a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
statement of those facts only which a sceptical inquirer
may admit to be historical.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACCEPTANCE BY THE "MANTELLATE."</div>

<p>Thus denuded of all devotional "improvement,"
and of all those portions of the narrative which alone
clerical writers have for the most part thought much
worth preserving, the story can present but a very
skeleton outline indeed; for the notices of the Saint
to be met with in contemporary lay writers are singularly
few and scanty.</p>

<p>Catherine was one of the youngest of a family of
twenty-five children. Her twin sister died a few days
after her birth. At a very early age she was observed
to be taciturn, and solitary in her habits; and was
remarkable for the small quantity of nourishment she
took. At about twelve years old she manifested her
determination to devote herself to a religious life.
The modes of this manifestation, and the difficulties
she encountered in carrying her wishes into execution
against the opposition of her family, as related by her
biographer, are curious; but cannot be admitted into
this chapter of "facts."</p>

<p>Some few years later than this, it should seem,&mdash;but
Father Raymond's aversion to dates does not
permit us to ascertain exactly at what age,&mdash;Catherine,
with much difficulty, and being confined to her bed by
illness at the time, persuaded her mother to go to
certain religious women attached to the order of St.
Dominic, and prefer to them her petition to be
admitted among them. These devotees were termed&mdash;"Mantellate
di S. Domenico,"&mdash;"the cloaked women
of St. Dominic;" and they appear to have been
bound by the vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience.
But they were not strictly nuns, as they were not
cloistered, but lived each in her own habitation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
went about the city freely. On these grounds the
Mantellate made much difficulty about receiving Catherine
into their society; alleging, that they conferred
their habit only on widows, or elderly single women, as
scandal would be caused by a young woman leading a
single but uncloistered life. On being further urgently
entreated, however, on the behalf of Catherine, they
agreed to send a deputation of their body to visit the
sick girl, promising to receive her, if it should be
found that, though young, she was not pretty. The
deputed judges came; and to Catherine's great delight
pronounced favourably as to the absence of any disqualifying
personal charms; though the more gallant
confessor insinuates, that their decision was in great
part influenced by the effects of illness on the candidate's
appearance. She was accordingly made a
sister of St. Dominic, and placed under the spiritual
guidance and direction of the friars of that order.</p>

<p>Then we have exceedingly copious accounts of
penitences, austerities, and abstinence, which, though
in all probability true to a frightful degree, yet, certainly
cannot, as related by Father Raymond, be
accepted as unmiraculous truths. One circumstance
mentioned by him, however, at this point of his narrative,
does not seem liable to any suspicion, and is
worth noting. Her early confessors, he says, did not
believe the miraculousness of her fasts and sufferings.</p>

<p>From this period to the end of her life we have
accounts of her frequent, apparently daily, "ecstasies,"
or fits. And it is interesting to observe, that the
descriptions of these seizures given by her biographer
on more than one occasion, show them to have been
very evidently of a cataleptic nature. The Dominican
monk of course has not, or at least does not manifest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the least suspicion that these "ecstasies" were attributable
to any other than a directly miraculous cause.
But his account is sufficiently accurate to render the
matter satisfactorily clear to modern readers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FATHER RAYMOND'S DOUBTS.</div>

<p>The passage, in which he first speaks of these fits,
of his own doubts concerning the nature of them, and
especially of the mode he adopted to arrive at a correct
decision on this point, is sufficiently curious.</p>

<p>"Shortly<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> afterwards," he says, having been telling
the story of some vision, "she lost the use of her
corporal senses and fell into ecstasy. Hence proceeded
all the wonderful things that subsequently took place,
both as regards her abstinence, such as is not practised
by others, her admirable teaching, and the manifest
miracles, which Almighty God, even during her lifetime,
showed before our eyes. Wherefore, since here
is the foundation, the root, and the origin of all her
holy works.... I sought every means and
every way, by which I might investigate whether her
operations were from the Lord, or from another
source,&mdash;whether they were true or fictitious. For I
reflected, that now was the time of that third beast
with the leopard's skin, by which hypocrites are pointed
out; and that in my own experience I had found some,
especially among the women, who easily deceive themselves,
and are more readily seduced by the enemy,
as was manifested in the case of the first mother of us
all. Other matters also presented themselves to my
mind, which constrained me to remain uncertain and
dubious concerning this matter. While I was thus in
doubt, unable to acquire a strong conviction on either
side of the question, and anxiously wishing to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
guided by Him, who can neither deceive nor be
deceived, it struck me, that if I could be certain, that
by means of her prayers I had obtained from the Lord
a great and unusual sense of contrition for my sins,
beyond anything I was wont to feel, this should be for
me a perfect proof that all her operations proceeded
from the Holy Ghost."</p>

<p>He then recounts at length, what may be as well
told in a few words,&mdash;how he besought her to pray for
him, telling her, that he desired to have a proof of
the efficacy of her prayer by being conscious of an unusually
strong sense of contrition within himself,&mdash;how
she promised that he assuredly should have this
proof,&mdash;how he was next day confined to his bed by
illness, and so weak as to be hardly able to speak; and
how, being then visited and exhorted by Catherine,
who herself left with difficulty a sick bed to come to
him, he <i>did</i> feel especially and unusually contrite;
and so the required proof was complete, and he was
ever after ready to accept any amount of miraculous
performance on the part of the Saint with perfect
faith in its reality and sanctity.</p>

<p>Did the diplomatist General of the Dominicans
really think that he had obtained the <i>proof</i>, he says he
wished for? Were the other women, whom he had
deemed impostors or dupes of the evil one, equally
devoted to and in the hands of the Dominican Order,
equally fervent and promising in their vocation of
saintship, and equally endowed with the strength of
character and will, which united to her physical infirmities,
rendered Catherine so rarely and highly valuable
an instrument for the promotion of "religion"
and the glory of the order?&mdash;questions, which must
be left to the consideration of the reader.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
On a subsequent occasion, Father Raymond describes<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
more at length the nature of the seizure, to
which Catherine was subject. We are told that,&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER ECSTASIES.</div>

<p>"Whenever the remembrance of her sacred husband,"&mdash;by
which phrase thousands of times repeated
in the course of his work, the monk always alludes to
our Saviour,&mdash;"became a little refreshed in that holy
mind, <i>she withdrew herself as much as she could</i> from her
corporal senses; and her extremities, that is to say, her
hands and her feet became contracted and deadened;
her fingers first. Then her limbs became so strongly
fixed both in themselves, and attached to the places
which they touched, that it would have been more
possible to break them to pieces than to remove them
in any wise. The eyes also were perfectly closed;
and the neck was rendered so rigid, that it was not a
little dangerous to her to touch her neck at such
moments."</p>

<p>The frequency and duration of these attacks appear
to have increased. At a later period<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of his narrative,
Father Raymond tells us that "the inferior and
sensitive part of her nature abandoned her for the
greater part of her time, and left her deprived of
sensation. Of which," he says, "we are assured a
thousand times by seeing and touching her arms and
her hands so rigidified, that it would have been easier
to break the bone, than remove them from the position
in which they were. The eyes were completely shut;
the ears did not hear any sound however great, and all
the bodily senses were entirely deprived of their proper
action."</p>

<p>These passages will leave little doubt on the minds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of any who have witnessed the phenomena of catalepsy,
that Catherine was habitually subject to attacks of that
complaint. The hint to be derived from the writer's
declaration, that she threw herself into this state "as
much as she could," is worthy of notice; and will not
seem surprising to those who have studied this form
of disease. Those also, who have watched the physical
phenomena of animal magnetism, will not fail to remark
the similarity of the facts recorded of Catherine, to
those they have been accustomed to observe.</p>

<p>For several years of her life after her profession, and
previous to 1376, we find various undated intimations
of her being in different cities of Tuscany; and Father
Raymond has recorded her complaints, that people
both secular and of "the order," had been scandalised
by her frequent travelling, whereas she had never gone
any whither, she declares, except for the salvation of
souls. But when it is remembered what travelling was in
those days, and that to go from Siena to Florence, Pisa,
or Lucca, was to cross the frontier of her own country,
and traverse the dominions of foreign and often hostile
states, it seems strange, that a young girl of obscure
origin, and necessarily with small pecuniary resources
at her command, should have found the means of
travelling about the world, accompanied, as she appears
always to have been, by a suite of confessors and other
ecclesiastical followers. To render these journeyings
yet more difficult and puzzling, we find contemporary
mention of her frequent illness. She is again and
again confined to her bed by fever, and "her ordinary
infirmities," and "accustomed sufferings;"&mdash;a state
of things that would seem to put out of the question
for her the wandering mendicant friar's ordinary inexpensive
mode of locomotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PAPAL SEE AT AVIGNON.</div>

<p>Not a word, however, is to be found throwing light
on any such difficulties; and they must be left to the
reader, as they present themselves. It may be noted,
however,&mdash;rather, though, to the increase than to the
lessening of the strangeness of the circumstances,&mdash;that
by special Papal Bull she was permitted to
carry with her a portable travelling altar, and the
confessors who accompanied her were specially licensed
to absolve all such penitents as came to the Saint for
spiritual advice and edification.</p>

<p>In the year 1376 Catherine was in her twenty-ninth
year; and we then come to the most important and
most remarkable incident in her career. At that time
Gregory XI., the last of seven French popes, who had
succeeded one another in the chair of St. Peter, was
living at Avignon, where for the last seventy-three
years the Papal Court had resided to the infinite discontent
and considerable injury of Italy. To put an
end to this absenteeism, and bring back the Pontiff,
and all the good things that would follow in his train,
was the cherished wish of all good Italians, and especially
of all Italian churchmen. Petrarch had urgently
pressed Gregory's predecessor, Urban V., to accomplish
the desired change; Dante had at an earlier period
laboured to accomplish the same object. But it was
not altogether an easy step to take. The French
Cardinals who surrounded the Pope at Avignon were
of course eager to keep him and the Court in their own
country. The King of France was equally anxious to
detain him. The French Pope's likings and prejudices
of course pointed in the same direction. Rome
too was very far just then from offering an agreeable
or inviting residence. The dominions of the
Church were in a state of almost universal rebellion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
The turbulence of the great Roman barons was
such, that going to live among them seemed as
safe and as pleasant as finding a residence in a den
of ruffians.</p>

<p>Thus all the representations of the Italian Church,
and all the spiritual and temporal interests, which so
urgently needed the ruler's presence in his dominions,
had for some years past not sufficed to bring back the
Pope to Rome. Under these circumstances Catherine,
the obscure Sienese dyer's illiterate daughter, determined
to try her powers of persuasion and argument
on the Pontiff, and proceeded to Avignon for that
purpose in the summer of 1376. In the September of
that same year, the Pope set out on his return to
Rome! The dyer's daughter succeeded in her enterprise,
and moved the centre of Europe once more back
again to its old place in the eternal city!</p>

<p>It should seem, that she was also charged by the
government of Florence, then at war with the Pope, to
make their peace with him. And this object also,
though it was not accomplished on the occasion of her
visit to Avignon, she appears to have subsequently
contributed to bring to a satisfactory termination.
But it is remarkable, that in none of the six letters to
Gregory, written in the early months of 1376, does she
speak a word on the subject of Florence. The great
object of her anxiety is the Pope's return to Rome.
There are four letters extant written by her<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to
Gregory, while she was in Avignon. But neither in
these is the business of the Florentines touched on.
So that we must suppose, says Father Burlamacchi in
his notes to Letter VII., that this affair was treated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the Pope and the Saint in personal interviews,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> or in
other letters now lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER LETTERS TO POPE GREGORY.</div>

<p>But it seems strange, that she should write elaborate
letters to a person inhabiting the same town, and
with whom she was doubtless in the habit of having
frequent personal intercourse. And the suspicion
naturally arises that these compositions were intended,
at all events in great measure, for the perusal of others
besides the person to whom they were avowedly written.
One of them is extant in the form of a Latin translation
by Father Raymond. It is true, that that language was
probably the only medium of communication between
the Italian Saint and the French Pope. Nevertheless,
the question,&mdash;Did this letter ever originally exist in
any other form than the Dominican's Latin presents
itself.</p>

<p>The following testimony however of the historian
Ammirato, who wrote about two hundred years after
the events of which we are speaking, seems to show
decisively, that from her own time to that of the
author, she was generally considered to have been the
principal cause of the restoration of the Papal Court
to Rome.</p>

<p>"There was living," he writes,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> "in those days a
young virgin born in Siena, who from the great
austerity of her life, from the fervour of her zeal of
charity, and indefatigable perseverance in all good
works, was even in her lifetime deemed holy by all,
and is so by the writer of these lines, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
reader may perceive, that he has no special devotion
to her. Nor was this opinion conceived without the
appearance to many persons of wonderful signs of a
miraculous and supernatural character." Having
briefly described these wonders in words, which certainly
do not reveal any disbelief of them in his own
mind, he continues thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It came into the minds therefore of those, who
then governed Florence, that she might be of use in
effecting a treaty of peace with the Pope. And if
they had themselves no really sincere desire for this,
yet the employment of her in the matter served to
prove to others, who were opposed to the war with the
Pope, that no efforts were wanting on their part to
obtain peace. Being, therefore, urged by the war<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
commissioners to proceed to Avignon on this mission,
she did not refuse to undertake it, but went thither,
as is related by herself in one of her letters. And it is
a certain fact, not only that she was well received and
affectionately listened to by the Pope, but that by her
instances he was induced to restore the Apostolic seat
to Rome."</p>

<p>Not having been able to bring the negotiation for
peace to a conclusion, she returned to Florence in the
autumn of 1376, and remained there living in a house
provided for her by Niccolò Soderini<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and others connected
with the government, while she continued to
use her influence in every possible way for the conclusion
of a treaty. Becoming thus well known to the
Florentines, she was, says Ammirato, "considered by
some to be a bad woman, as in more recent times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
similar opinions have been held respecting Jerome
Savonarola."</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHE RESTORES THE POPE TO ROME.</div>

<p>It should seem, however, that Catherine must have
been favourably known in Florence some years before
this time from an incidental notice of the chronicler,
Del Migliore, who has recorded that in 1370 her
brothers were publicly presented with the freedom
of the city. And it is difficult to suppose that such an
honour could have been conferred on them on any
other grounds than the celebrity of their saintly sister.</p>

<p>Muratori also testifies,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> that Catherine contributed
much to the restoration of the Papal Court to Rome,
saying that she wrote to the Pope on the subject. He
appears not to have been aware that she went thither.</p>

<p>Again, Maimbourg, who took the contrary side in
the great schism, which so soon afterwards divided the
Church into two camps, and who is far from being
prejudiced in favour of Catherine, admits that the
Pope, "resolved at last to re-establish the see in Rome,
in consequence of the urgent and repeated solicitations
of St. Catherine of Siena."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The Abate Ughelli bears his testimony<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> also to the
efficacy of Catherine's exertions in this matter.</p>

<p>"The greatest part," he says, "of the praise due to
Gregory's return to Rome belongs to Catherine of
Siena, who with infinite courage made the journey to
Avignon, and at last induced the Pontiff to return, and
by his presence dispel those evils which had shockingly
overrun all Italy in consequence of the absence of the
popes. So that it is not surprising, that writers,
who rightly understood the matter, should have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
that Catherine, the virgin of Siena, brought back to
God the abandoned Apostolical seat oil her shoulders."</p>

<p>It should appear, then, that it must be admitted,
strange as it may seem, among the <i>facts</i> of the Saint's
life, that the restoration of the Pope and his Court to
Rome, that great change so important to all Europe,
so long battled and struggled for and against by kings,
cardinals, and statesmen, was at last brought about
by her.</p>

<p>Without pausing at present to look further into a
result so startling, it will be better to complete this
chapter, by briefly adding the few other authentically
known facts of her story which remain to be told.</p>

<p>Gregory XI. died on the 27th of March, 1378. On
the 7th of April sixteen cardinals entered into conclave
for the election of his successor. Of these, eleven
were Frenchmen, and all of course anxious to elect a
Frenchman. But seven out of the eleven being
Limousins, were bent on creating one of their number
Pope. The other four Frenchmen were opposed to
this; and by favour of this dissension the Italians
succeeded in placing an Italian, Bartolomeo Prignani,
in the sacred chair, who took the name of Urban VI.</p>

<p>This took place while Catherine was still at Florence.
There are two letters written by her thence to the new
Pope. In one of them she alludes to a "scandalo,"
which had occurred; and was in truth nothing less
than a city tumult, in which some turbulent rioters of
the anti-church party had threatened her life. It is
recorded,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> that the Saint intrepidly presented herself
before the mob, saying, "I am Catherine. Kill me, if
you will!"&mdash;on which they were abashed and slunk off.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">HER DEATH.</div>

<p>Two other letters to Urban VI. follow, which appear
to have been written from Siena; and on the 28th of
November, 1378, in obedience to the Papal commands,
she arrived in Rome. There are then four more
letters written to the Pope after that date; and on the
29th day of April, 1380, she died at the age of thirty-three,
after long and excruciating sufferings.</p>

<p>Father Raymond was at Genoa at that time; and
declares that in that city at the hour of her death, he
heard a voice communicating to him a last message
from Catherine, which he afterwards found she had
uttered on her death-bed, word for word as he heard
it. "And of this," he adds, solemnly, "let that
Eternal Truth, which can neither deceive nor be
deceived, be witness." Nevertheless, some may be
inclined to think that this statement has no right to
be included among the <i>facts</i> of the case. Such sceptics
may, however, be reminded that it is a certain and not
altogether unimportant fact, that Father Raymond
makes this solemn assertion.</p>

<p>The extant letters of the Saint, 198 in number,
are also facts, of a very singular and puzzling nature.
But it will be more convenient to defer any examination
of this part of the subject to a future and separate
chapter.</p>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center p1 mid">THE CHURCH VIEW OF THE CASE.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Authentic history, conceiving herself justified, probably,
in leaving a saint in the hands of her own
professional advisers and chroniclers, has meddled so
little with Catherine biographically, that it was easy to
give within the limits of a short chapter a tolerably
complete summary of all that can be said to be really
known of her story. The professional records of her
career as Saint and Thaumaturgist on the other hand
are exuberant, minute in detail, and based on abundance
of that sort of evidence to their veracity, which
the writers of such narratives are wont to consider as
most irrefragable and conclusive. And these stories
are by no means deficient in interest even to those,
whose habits of mind lead them to distinguish widely
between such and the materials for what they would
admit to be history. For it is a genuine historical
fact, and one of no light importance, that these things
<i>were</i> believed, were written by men of learning, and
are <i>still</i> believed by thousands. It is an historical, as
well as a very curious psychological fact, that the statements
in question were considered by the writers and
thousands of readers of them during many generations
to have been proved to be true by the evidence adduced.
And it is an historical question, far more
interesting, unfortunately, than easy to be solved, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
were the believers of the officially received narrative,
and who were not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER AUSTERITIES.</div>

<p>For these reasons the Church view of the case, is at
least as important a part of any satisfactory account
of the Saint as the lay view, which was the subject of
the last chapter. But all attempt to state the former
with the completeness with which it has been sought
to lay the latter before the reader, would, within any
limits endurable by Englishmen of the nineteenth
century, be wholly futile. It will be necessary to proceed
by way of specimen-giving. And in the present
case that compendious mode of examination will not
be so unsatisfactory as it sometimes is found to be.
For the masses of visions, penitences, revelations, and
miracles recorded, with their respective confirmatory
evidences, are so perfectly homogeneous in their nature,
that the handful may very confidently be accepted as a
fair sample of the contents of the sack.</p>

<p>The austerities and self-inflictions by which she
prepared herself for her career internally, and at the
same time gave proof of her vocation externally to
those around her, began at an almost incredibly early
age, and went on increasing gradually in intensity and
monstrosity till they pass from the probable to the
highly improbable, and thence to the manifestly impossible
and miraculous. The line of demarcation which
limits the latter, will be differently drawn by different
minds. But the perfectly authentic records of human
achievement in this department, are such as warn us
against absolutely refusing our belief to any horrible
self-torment under which life may possibly be retained.</p>

<p>At <i>five</i> years old, it was her practice in going up
stairs to kneel at each step to the Virgin.</p>

<p>She habitually flogged herself, and induced other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
children to imitate her in doing so, at six years of age.
At seven, she deprived herself of a great portion of
her food, secretly giving it to her brother, or throwing
it to the cats. At the same age, she would watch from
the window to see when a Dominican monk passed,
and as soon as ever he had moved on, she used to run
out and kiss the spot on the pavement on which he
had placed his feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER GREAT SIN.</div>

<p>At twelve years old, being then marriageable, her
mother begged her to comb her hair and "wash her
face oftener." But this she steadfastly refused to do,
till her mother having requested a married sister for
whom Catherine had the warmest affection, to use her
influence with her, she yielded, and began to pay some
attention to the cleanliness of her person and the neatness
of her dress. "When she afterwards confessed
this fault to me," says the "Blessed" Raymond, "she
spoke of it with such sighs and tears, that you would
have supposed she had been guilty of some great sin.
And as I know that, now that she is in heaven, it is
lawful for me to reveal such things as redound to her
praise, though they were heretofore secret, I have
determined to insert here what passed between her
and me on this subject. For she frequently made a
general<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> confession to me, and always when she came
to this point, she bitterly accused herself with sobs and
tears. So that although I knew that it is the peculiarity
of virtuous souls to believe that sin exists where
in truth it does not,"&mdash;(observe the morality and think
a little of the practical and psychological consequences
of it)&mdash;"and to deem it great, where it is in fact
small, nevertheless, since Catherine accused herself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
meriting eternal punishment for the above fault, I was
obliged to ask her, whether in acting as she had done,
she had at all proposed or wished to violate her vow of
chastity? To which she replied, that no such thought
had ever entered her heart. I again asked her, whether,
since she had no intention of transgressing her vow of
virginity, she had done this in order to please any man
in particular, or all men in general? And she answered
that nothing gave her so much pain, as to see
men, or be seen by them, or to be where any of them
were. So that whenever any of her father's workmen,
who lived in the house with him, came into any place
where she chanced to be, she used to run from them,
as if they had been serpents, so that all wondered at
her." (Note the general state of manners and individual
state of mind indicated by the fact, that such
conduct should be deemed a praiseworthy proof of
maidenly purity!) "She never," she said, "placed
herself at the window, or at the door of the house to
look at those who passed."&mdash;(Surely the Saint forgot
her pious habit of looking out for the Dominicans, in
order to kiss their footsteps.)&mdash;"Then I asked her in
reply, for what reason this act of having attended to
her dress, especially if it were not done in excess,
merited eternal punishment? She answered, that she
had loved her sister too much, and appeared to love
her more than she loved God, for which reason she
wept inconsolably, and did most bitter penance. And
on my wishing to reply, that, although there might
have been some excess, yet seeing that there had been
no bad or even vain intention, there was nothing
contrary to divine precept, she lifted up her eyes and
voice to God, crying, 'O Lord my God, what kind of
spiritual father have I now, who excuses my sins?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Was it right then, Father, that this bad and most
worthless creature, who without labour or merit of her
own has received so many favours from her Creator,
should spend her time in adorning this putrid flesh, at
the instigation of any mortal? Hell, I think, would
have been no sufficient punishment for me, if the divine
mercy had not shown me pity.' Thereupon," concludes
the conscientious confessor, "I was constrained
to be silent." He felt that his penitent's view of her
sin was the just one, as indeed was sufficiently shown
by the following conclusion of the story of the Saint's
temporary backsliding.</p>

<p>Her sister continued to persuade her to pay attention
to her person. "But the omnipotent Lord not
being able any longer to endure that his chosen bride
should in any way be kept at a distance from him,
removed that obstacle which prevented her from
uniting herself to God. For Bonaventura, the Saint's
married sister, who instigated her to vanity, being near
the time of her confinement, died in child-birth, young
as she was. Observe, O reader, how displeasing and
hateful to God it is to impede or divert those who wish
to serve him. This Bonaventura was, as has been said,
a very worthy woman, both in her conduct and in her
conversation; but because she endeavoured to draw
back to the world her who wished to serve God, she
was smitten by the Lord, and punished with a very
painful death." Take care, therefore, what you do, all
mothers and sisters, of any who may seem to have a
vocation for the cloister, lest you share the fate of
Bonaventura Benincasa, doomed by God to a fearful
death for having persuaded her sister to wash her face!</p>

<p>And to such practical teaching is the Saint's story
moralised to this day even as 500 years ago!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HER FASTING.</div>

<p>At about this period of Catherine's life&mdash;to return to
the series of her penances and mortifications&mdash;she
wholly abandoned the use of animal food. At fifteen
she left off wine. At twenty she gave up bread, living
only on uncooked vegetables. She used to sleep but
one quarter of an hour in the twenty-four; always
flogged herself till the blood streamed from her three
times a day; and lived three years without speaking.
She wore a chain of iron round her body, which
gradually eat its way into her flesh. And finally, she
remained wholly without food for many years. This
Father Raymond declares to have been the case within
his own knowledge, and adds with much triumph,
"that we know from Scripture that Moses fasted
twice during a space of forty days, and Elias once,
and that our Saviour accomplished the same, as the
Gospel tells us: but a fast of many years has not
hitherto been known."</p>

<p>Passing from the Saint's achievements in this kind,
we find her equally distancing all competitors in the
matter of personal and familiar communication and
conversation with the Deity.</p>

<p>She began to have visions at six years old. Returning
home one day about that time, through the streets of
Siena, she saw in the sky <i>immediately over the Dominican's
church</i> a throne, with Christ sitting on it dressed
in Papal robes, accompanied by St. Paul, St. Peter, and
St. John.</p>

<p>At a later period, Christ appeared to her daily as
soon as she retired to her cell, as she informed Father
Raymond, for the purpose of teaching her the doctrines
of religion, which, said she to her confessor,
"no man or woman ever taught me, but only our Lord
Jesus Christ himself, sometimes by means of inspiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and sometimes by means of a clear bodily
appearance, manifest to the bodily senses, and talking
with me, as I now talk with you."</p>

<p>Again, a little farther on in her career, we read that
"the Lord appeared to Catherine very frequently, and
remained with her longer than he had been wont to do,
and sometimes brought with him his most glorious
mother, sometimes St. Dominic, and sometimes both
of them: but mostly he came alone and talked with
her, as a friend with a most intimate friend; in such
sort, that, as she herself secretly and blushingly confessed
to me, the Lord and she frequently recited the
Psalms together, walking up and down the chamber, as
two monks or priests are wont to recite the service.
Oh, marvel! Oh, astonishment! Oh, manifestation of
divine familiarity unheard of in our times!" exclaims
the biographer: as he truly well might!</p>

<p>Very soon after this, having tried in vain, as she
informed her confessor, to learn to read, she one day
prayed God, that, if it was His will that she should
read, he would teach her at once, to avoid further loss
of time in learning. She rose from her knees perfectly
well able to read any writing as readily and quickly as
any learned man could. This Father Raymond heard
her do; but on asking her to spell the words she could
not, and did not know the letters; a proof, says the
confessor, of the reality of the miracle! In another
place it is incidentally mentioned that she read especially
the <i>Psalter</i>. Does not this, joined to the Dominican's
<i>proof</i> of the miracle, seem to indicate, that what
passed for reading was in fact repeating by heart?</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER MARRIAGE.</div>

<p>On a subsequent day, in carnival time, while the
others in the Saint's family were carousing, and she
was alone in her chamber, Christ appeared to her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
said that he was come to keep his promise of marrying
her. Then appeared the Virgin, St. John, St. Paul,
and St. Dominic, and David with a harp, on which
he played very sweetly. The Virgin then took Catherine's
hand in hers, and holding out the fingers towards
her son, asked if he would deign to espouse her
"in the faith. To which the only begotten Son of God
graciously consented, and drew forth a golden ring,
with four pearls and a magnificent diamond in it, which
ring he placed with his own most holy right hand on
the ring-finger of the right hand of Catherine, saying,
'Behold I marry you in the faith to me your Creator
and Saviour.'" After adding some further exhortations,
the vision disappeared; but as a proof of its reality,
there remained the ring on the finger of Catherine!
It was not indeed visible to any eyes but those of the
Saint herself, adds Father Raymond with perfect composure
and contentment; but she saw it, inasmuch
as she has many times confessed to me, though with
many blushes, that she always continued to see the
ring on her finger, and was never long without looking
at it.</p>

<p>One day while she was praying to God to <i>renew her
heart</i>, Christ suddenly appeared to her&mdash;or, in the
words of the biographer, her eternal spouse came
to her as usual&mdash;opened her side, removed her
heart, and carried it away with him. So truly was
this done, that for several days she declared herself to
be without any heart, pointing out to those who
objected that it was impossible, that with God nothing
is impossible. After some days Christ again appeared,
bearing in his hand what seemed a human heart, red
and shining, again opened her side, put the new heart
in, and closed the aperture, saying, "See, dearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
daughter; as I took from you the other day your
heart, so now I will give you mine, with which you
will always live!" And as a proof of the miracle,
there remained evermore in her side the scar, as she
herself and her female companions had often assured
Father Raymond. A further confirmation of the fact
was moreover to be seen in the remarkable circumstance,
that from that day forth, the saint was unable
to say, as she had been wont, "Lord, I commend to
thee my heart," but always said, "Lord, I commend to
thee thy heart."</p>

<p>Another time the first person of the Trinity appeared
to her "in a vision," and she seemed to see him pull
from out his mouth our Saviour Christ in his human
form. Then he pulled from out his breast St. Dominic,
and said to her, "Dearest daughter, I have
begotten these two sons, the one by natural generation,
the other by sweet and loving adoption." Then the
Almighty enters into a detailed comparison between
Christ and St. Dominic, and ends by saying, that the
figure of the latter had now been shown her "because
he resembled much the body of my most holy naturally
begotten and only son."</p>

<p>Once when she was carrying some comforts to a sick
poor woman, Christ, "joking with her," suddenly made
the things so heavy that she could hardly carry them.
Then, when she wished to leave the sick woman, still
jesting, he took from her the power of moving. Being
troubled, therefore, and yet at the same time smiling,
she said to her heavenly spouse, who was jesting with
her, "Why, dearest husband, have you thus tricked
me? Does it seem to you well to keep me here, and
thus mock and confuse me?" She adds more remonstrances
of this sort, and at last, "the eternal husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
seeing the secret annoyance of his wife, and not being
in a manner able to endure it, he restored to her her
previous strength."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BEGGAR-MAN.</div>

<p>Upon another occasion, when she was at her devotions
in the church of the Dominicans, a poor beggar,
<i>who appeared to be about thirty-two or thirty-three years
old</i>, implored her to bestow on him some clothing.
The Saint bade him wait a minute; and returning into
a private chapel, she drew off by the feet, "cautiously
and modestly," says Father Raymond, an under garment
without sleeves, which she wore under her outer
clothing because of the cold, and very gladly gave it to
the poor man. Upon which the beggar replied, "Madonna,
since you have furnished me with a woollen garment,
I pray you to provide me with one of linen also."
To which she willingly consented, saying, "Follow me,
and I will readily give you what you ask." So she
returned to her father's house, followed by the poor
man, and going into a store room, where the linen
clothing of her father and brothers was kept, she took
a shirt and pair of drawers and joyfully gave them to
him. But he, when he had got these, did not desist
from begging, saying, "Madonna, what can I do with
this garment, which has no sleeves to cover the arms.
I beg you to give me some sleeves of some sort, that
so my whole clothing may be your gift." Upon this,
Catherine, not the least displeased with his importunity,
searched all over the house to find some sleeves
to give him. And finding by chance, hanging on a
peg, a new gown belonging to the servant, which she had
never yet worn, she instantly stripped the sleeves from
it, and gave them to the beggar. But he, when he had
taken them, still persevered, saying, "See now, Madonna,
you have clothed me, for which may He reward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
you, for love of whom you have done it. But I have a
companion in the hospital, who is in extreme want of
clothing. If you will give him some garment, I would
willingly carry it to him from you." Upon which,
Catherine, in no wise displeased at the poor man's
reiterated demands, or cooled in the fervour of her
charity, bethought her how she could find some
clothing to send to the poor man in the hospital. But,
in the words of the biographer monk, "remembering
that all the family, except her father, disapproved of
her almsgiving, and kept all they had under lock and
key, to prevent her from giving the things away to the
poor, and further discreetly considering that she had
taken away enough from the servant, who was herself
poor, and therefore ought not to have everything taken
from her, she found that her resources were confined
wholly to herself. She, therefore, seriously discussed
in her mind the question, whether she ought to give
the poor wretch the only garment which remained to
her. Charity argued for the affirmative; but maidenly
modesty opposed a negative. And in this contest
charity was overcome by charity. That is to say, the
charity which pities the bodies of our neighbour, was
conquered by the charity which regards their souls;
since Catherine considered that great scandal would
arise if she were to go naked, and that souls ought not
to be scandalised for the sake of any alms to the body."
Accordingly, she told the beggar, that she would
willingly have given him that, her only covering, if it
had been lawful to do so&mdash;but that it was not permissible.
"I know," said he, smiling, "that you would
give me anything you could. Adieu!" And so he
went. On the following night, however, Christ came
to her, holding in his hand the garment she had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the poor man, now all adorned with pearls and gems,
and said, "Dost thou know this gown? Thou gavest
it to <i>me</i> yesterday, and charitably clothedst me when I
was naked, saving me from the pain of cold and shame.
Now I will give thee from my sacred body a garment,
which, though invisible to men, shall preserve both thy
body and soul from cold." So saying, he pulled from
out the wound in his side a garment of the colour of
blood, exceedingly resplendent, and clothed her with
it. And, in fact, so perfectly did it fulfil, though
invisible, the purpose for which it was given, that the
Saint never afterwards wore any under garment, either
in summer or winter, nor did she ever more suffer from
the cold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HEAVENLY GARMENT.</div>

<p>It occurred frequently, that the most hardened
sinners were reclaimed by her intervention, but not by
the means of exhortation or persuasion&mdash;(in this there
would have been nothing worth telling)&mdash;but by direct
application to God, and asking the required conversion
as a favour to herself. There was a certain
inveterate reprobate in Siena, who having led an
exceedingly wicked life, was near his death, and obstinately
refused to confess, or humble himself in any
way. "Fallen into final impenitence, he continually
committed that sin against the Holy Ghost, which is
not forgiven either in this world, or the world to come,
and thus deservedly was going down to eternal
torments," says Father Raymond. In short, if he had
lived anywhere but in Siena, or if his parish priest had
not bethought him of applying to Catherine in the
difficulty, he would infallibly have perished eternally.
But what luck some people have! Catherine, on
being applied to, undertook the case immediately, but
found it a rather more difficult one than usual; for, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
praying to Christ to rescue the dying sinner, he
answered her by saying, "The iniquities of this man,
horrible blasphemer as he is, have risen up to heaven.
Not only has he blasphemed with his mouth me and
my saints, but he has even thrown into the fire a
picture, in which was my image, and that of my mother,
and others of my saints. It is, therefore just that he
should burn in eternal fire. Let him alone, my dearest
daughter, for he is worthy of death." Catherine,
however, replied with many arguments, given at length
by her biographer; but, nevertheless, for a long time
she could not prevail. From five in the evening till
the morning, Catherine, watching and tearful, disputed
with the Lord for the salvation of that soul, he alleging
the sinner's many and grave sins, which justice required
to be punished, and she insisting on the mercy, for the
sake of which he had become incarnate. At last the
Saint conquered, and at dawn of day Christ said,
"Dearest daughter, I have granted your prayer, and I
will now convert this man, for whom you pray so
fervently." So from that hour all went well. The
sinner began to confess, the priest began to absolve
him, and he died within a few hours. But it was a
very near run thing. For the priest who had applied
to Catherine had found on reaching her house, that
she was in a trance or ecstasy, and could not be spoken
with. He waited as long as he could, and when he
could wait no longer, he left a message with a companion
of Catherine's to the desired effect. As it was,
all went well. But it is clear that if a few hours more
had been lost, if the Saint's trance had lasted longer,
or her long argument on the subject had not been concluded
when it was, or if the woman with whom the
message was left, had made any blunder about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
matter, or forgotten it, the man's evil life would have
produced its natural consequences according to God's
eternal law, and he would have been damned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MIRACLE DONE ON HER MOTHER.</div>

<p>It has been suggested by some, eager to exercise the
candour which can see whatever of excellence there
may be in every system, that the many stories of
Catherine's successful efforts to convert the most
hardened sinners, are a proof of her having possessed
that confidence in the latent good in every human
heart which is one of the best results of a truly philosophic
faith in God; and which would in truth go far
to show that her heart unconsciously, if not her intellect
consciously, had placed her in advance of the
ethics and theology of her day. But the story just
related fatally destroys any such agreeable theory. The
conversion of the sinner was to be achieved not by any
human action on his heart, but by wholly different
means. The Saint did not even seek to see or speak
with him. The conversion was to be a miracle, worked
as a special favour granted to her. The dying sinner's
moral capabilities had nothing whatever to do with the
matter.</p>

<p>There is another even more remarkable instance in
which the Saint prevails with God to work a miracle,
which He declares at the time to be hurtful to the
person who is the subject of it. Catherine's mother,
Lapa, was dying, but was most unwilling to die. Her
daughter, therefore, prayed that her health might be
restored to her, but was answered that it was better for
Lapa that she should leave this life then. With this
answer she returns to her mother, and endeavours to
reconcile her to the necessity of then dying, but in
vain. Thus the Saint became mediator between the
Lord and her mother, supplicating the one not to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Lapa out of the world against her will, and exhorting
the other to be resigned to the disposition of the Lord.
But Catherine, who with her prayers, constrained, as
it were, the Omnipotent, could not, by her exhortation,
bend the weak mind of her mother. So the Lord said
to his wife, "Tell your mother that if she will not leave
the body now, the time will come when she shall
greatly desire death, and not be able to find it."
Lapa, however, could not make up her mind to die,
nor would she confess in preparation for death; and,
accordingly, died unshriven. Then her daughter cried
to God, and said, "Oh, Lord God! are these then the
promises you made me, that no one of this house
should perish? * * * * * And now I see my mother
dead without the sacraments of the church! By thy
infinite mercy I pray thee, do not let me be defrauded
in such a manner! Nor will I move hence for an
instant as long as I live, until thou shalt render back
my mother to life." So God, although he knew that it
was bad for her mother, recalled her again to life; and
she lived to be eighty-nine years old, surviving all her
numerous children, tried by much adversity, and often
longing for that death which she had before so
unwisely rejected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE STIGMATA.</div>

<p>One of the most remarkable miraculous events
which occurred to her was the following, related by
Father Raymond as having happened at Pisa in his
presence. Catherine had received the sacrament, and
was, as usual with her at such times, in a trance. Her
confessor and some others were awaiting her recovery
from it, when they saw her suddenly rise with a start to
a kneeling posture, with her arms stretched out horizontally,
and in a minute or two more fall prostrate.
Soon afterwards she came out of her trance, and immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
calling aside her confessor, said, "Be it known
to you, my father, that I now bear on my body the
marks of the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ."
"And I," says the monk, "having told her that I had
observed as much from the movements of her body
while she was in her trance, asked her in what manner
the Lord had performed that miracle? And she said,
'I saw the crucified Lord descending towards me with
a great light, which caused me, from the impetus of
my soul to meet its Creator, to raise up my body, then I
saw five bloody rays descending from the scars of his
most holy wounds, and directing themselves to the hands
and feet and heart of my body. Upon which, knowing
what the mystery was, I exclaimed, "O Lord my God,
let not, I pray you, the scars appear externally on my
body; it is enough for me to have them internally."
Then, while I was yet speaking, the rays, before they
reached me, turned from blood-colour to a pure and
splendid light, and touched the five parts of my body,
that is, my hands, my feet, and my heart.' I asked
her further, 'Do you now feel in those spots any sensible
pain?' To which, with a deep sigh, she
replied, 'So great is the pain I feel in all those
five places, but especially in my heart, that it appears
impossible to me to live many days, unless the Lord
perform some further miracle.'"</p>

<p>To appreciate the importance and bearing of this
miracle, the fierce and bitter rivalry which existed
between the Dominicans and Franciscans must be
borne in mind. St. Francis had received these five
wounds, the counterpart of Christ's wounds, in the
same way. The marks are familiarly known among
hagiographers and their readers as the <i>stigmata</i>, and
the having received them was the crowning glory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
St. Francis, and the proud and exclusive boast of his
Franciscans: and now the Dominicans were even with
them. The Sienese Pope, who canonized Catherine,
Pius II., gave his approbation to a service, in which
this reception of the <i>stigmata</i> was prominently asserted.
And so severely was the blow felt by the indignant
Franciscans, that they obtained from the next Pope
but one, Sixtus the Fourth, himself a member of their
Order, a decree to the effect that St. Francis had an
exclusive right to, and monopoly of that special
miracle, and that it was accordingly forbidden to represent
St. Catherine receiving the <i>stigmata</i> under pain
of ecclesiastical censures!</p>

<p>Whether the opposition monk, Sixtus, intended by
this decree to assert that no such miracle was performed
on Catherine, or that it ought not to have been
performed in justice to St. Francis, or that having been
unfortunately performed, nothing ought to be said
about it, is left to the very unsatisfactory conjectures
of indiscreet inquirers.</p>

<p>The tendency observable in many of the austerities
and miracles related of St. Catherine, to outdo the
austerities and miracles of other saints, is especially
remarkable in this of the <i>stigmata</i>. The degree in
which it served the purpose of the Dominicans, is the
measure of the suspicion attaching to it. But as there is
nothing incredible in the supposition that Catherine
may have imagined all she related in her trance, so it
is by no means unlikely that such diseased dreamings
may have been the natural product of a waking fancy
filled with, and dwelling on this much envied manifestation.
Perhaps the condition so providently introduced,
as it seems, that the scars were not to be visible,
may be suggestive of a fraudulent intention. But, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the other hand, it should seem, that if fraud had been
planned, it would have been very easy, for one who
subjected her body to so much self-inflicted torment,
to submit to the required wounds beforehand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OTHER MIRACLES.</div>

<p>In another instance there seems to be emulation of
a higher model. Wishing to give wine away to the
poor against the desire of her family, she miraculously
causes a barrel to become for a long while inexhaustible,
the wine drawn from it being, at the same
time, of a much superior quality to that originally put
into it.</p>

<p>Many details are recorded of her ministry to the
sick; but, strangely enough, the most prominent circumstances
in each case, are those which go to prove
her readiness to encounter whatever was most loathesome;
and some of the particulars of her victories over
the natural repugnances of mind and body in this
respect&mdash;often of a nature in no wise conducive to, or
connected with the well-being of her patient&mdash;are far
too revolting for reproduction on any English page.</p>

<p>The reader has now an abundant&mdash;perhaps he may
think a superfluously abundant&mdash;specimen of that part
of Catherine's history which the Church most loves to
preserve, contemplate, and enlarge on, and of the kind
of teaching she draws from it&mdash;draws from it, be it
again observed, for this is an important part of the
subject&mdash;at this present day.</p>

<p>The morality set forth by example in the tales of
the Saint abstracting the property of her relatives to
give it to any mendicant who begged of her, is more
largely and accurately reduced to systematic precept
in the "Manual for Confessors," now in use as
the rule for those who have the guidance of the
popular conscience. It is there laid down, that a wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
or son may "take" from the goods of a husband or
father, who will not give for the purpose, what is
requisite for "good works!"</p>

<p>The stories which represent the Creator as capriciously
reversing his decrees with the unconscientious
levity of an earthly potentate ruled by an exacting
favourite, and inflicting undeserved torment and
miserable death in accordance with the suggestions of
evil passions wholly fiend-like, are still shaping the
Italian peasant's conception of the Almighty, and thus
poisoning the master well-head of all spiritual and
moral amelioration.</p>

<p>The depravation, or rather the annihilation of the
natural conscience, which necessarily results from
attributing fearful sinfulness to trifling and absurd
omissions and inadvertences, and from installing an
admiration for useless, and often mischievous practices
on the throne, which should be occupied in the human
soul by reverence for man's homely duties, and homely
affections, is still doing its appointed work as busily
and as surely as it did five hundred years ago, and
has been doing ever since,&mdash;with what results, we see.</p>

<p>But it is sufficient to have indicated to the reader
the importance, from this point of view, of this story
of a Saint, who, alas! but too truly "being dead, yet
speaketh." It would require an analysis extending
over the whole field of national character, to trace all
the ramified evil produced by the views of God and
man involved in such stories as those related in the
preceding pages. And if there were no other reason
against here attempting such an essay, it might
assuredly be urged, that such considerations have no
place in a chapter devoted to the Church view of the
case.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center p1 mid">ST. CATHERINE AS AN AUTHOR.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The literary phase of Catherine's career and character,
especially as seen in her letters, is by no means
its least curious and suggestive aspect. The indications
of what she herself was, and yet more, the
evidences obtainable from them of the undeniably
exceptional and extraordinary position she held among
her contemporaries, are valuable, and yet at the same
time not a little puzzling.</p>

<p>Her works consist of a treatise occupying a closely
printed quarto volume, which Father Raymond describes
as "a Dialogue between a Soul, which asked
four questions of the Lord, and the same Lord, who
made answer, and gave instruction in many most
useful truths;" of her letters, three hundred and
seventy-three in number; and of twenty-six prayers.</p>

<p>This Dialogue is entitled, "The book of Divine
Doctrine, given in person by God the Father, speaking
to the mind of the most glorious and holy Virgin,
Catherine of Siena, and written down as she dictated
it in the vulgar tongue, she being the while entranced,
and actually hearing that which God spoke in her." It
is stated to have been dictated by the Saint in her
father's house in Siena, a little before she went to
Rome, and to have been completed the 13th of
October, 1378. This dialogue has been divided into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
five parts, though no such division existed in it, as it
fell from her lips. The first part treats of Discretion;
the second of Prayer; the third of the Divine Providence;
the fourth of Obedience; and the fifth of
Consummate Perfection. The four first exist in
manuscript in the original Italian, as they were taken
down from the lips of the entranced Saint; though
these ancient manuscript copies abound, we are told
by the modern editor of them, Girolamo Gigli, with
such errors as frequently not only to alter the sense,
but to render it inconsistent with true orthodoxy. Of
course nothing but the purest doctrine could have
been uttered by the Saint, and these dangerous errors
have been corrected. But the fifth treatise is not
extant in the original, but only in Father Raymond's
Latin translation of it, from which the published
Italian version has been re-translated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER "DIALOGUE."</div>

<p>The French oratorian, Father Casimir Oudin,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> in
his Supplement of Ecclesiastical writers, omitted by
Bellarmine, quietly says, "She wrote, or Raymond
de Vineis wrote in her name, a work inscribed," &amp;c.
&amp;c. It is very possible, that the Frenchman's suspicion
may be just. But, with the exception of some allusions
and subtleties, indicating, perhaps, a greater
acquaintance with scholastic theology than the Saint
may be thought to have possessed, there is nothing in
the work itself to belie the origin attributed to it. It
could not, indeed, have been written down from the
Saint's dictation, as it professes to have been, in the
form and sequence in which we have it printed;
because it is intermingled (without any typographical
or other advertisement, that the reader is about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
enter on matter of a different authorship and pretensions)&mdash;with
long passages descriptive of the Saint's
mode of receiving the revelation, written in the person
of the secretary, and bearing a strong likeness to
Father Raymond's style and phraseology. But the
Saint's own utterances are exactly such as might have
been expected from such a patient, and much resemble
in many respects those which many readers have
probably heard in these latter days, from persons in
all likelihood similarly affected in greater or less
degree. As the latter have often been found to bear a
singular resemblance in quality and manner to the
verbose and repetitive inanities of some very slenderly
gifted extempore preacher, so these ecstatic outpourings
of St. Catherine are like the worst description
of the pulpit eloquence of her day and country.
Low and gross as the taste and feeling of the age were,
especially in matters spiritual and theological, it is
difficult to imagine that Catherine could have gained
any part of the great reputation and influence she
undeniably exercised in high places from this production.
The reader may see from the following
passage, taken quite at haphazard from its pages,
whether his impression on this point agrees with that
of the writer.</p>

<p>Catherine dictates these sentences as hearing them
word for word as she repeats them, from the mouth of
God!</p>

<p>"Know, O daughter! that no one can escape from
my hands, because I am He, who I am; and ye do not
exist by yourselves, but only in so far as ye are created
by Me, who am the Creator of all things that have
existence, except only Sin, which does not exist, and
therefore has not been created by me. And because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
is not in me, it is not worthy of being loved. And
therefore the Creature offends, because he loves that
which he ought not to love, which is sin, and hates
Me, whom he is bound and obliged to love; for I am
supremely good, and have given him existence by the
so ardent fire of my love. But from Me men cannot
escape. Either they fall into my hands for justice on
their sins, or they fall into my hands for mercy. Open
therefore the eyes of your mind, and look at my hand,
and you will see that what I have said to you is the
truth." <i>Then she raising her eyes in obedience to the
supreme Father</i>, "<i>saw</i> enclosed in his hand the entire
universe," &amp;c., &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>It is evident, that this could not have been written
from the Saint's dictation. But the work may have
been composed from notes taken down while she
poured forth her trance-talk. And such an hypothesis
would not be incompatible with Oudin's supposition,
that the book, as we have it, was composed by Father
Raymond. In any case the staple of its contents, if
not inferior to the generality of the theological literature
of the time, shows at least no such superiority to
it as to place the author in the high and exceptional
position Catherine is proved to have occupied.</p>

<p>Twenty-six prayers have been preserved among the
works of Saint Catherine; and it might be supposed,
that such a record of the secret outpourings of an
ardent heart in its communion with the infinite God,
sole object of its fervent aspirations and daily and
nightly meditations, would have been calculated to
throw considerable light on the character, capabilities,
and mental calibre of the worshipper. But these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
documents afford no glimpse of any such insight.
They are not the sort of utterances that could ever
bring one human heart nearer to another: and no
assimilating power of sympathy will enable the reader
of them to advance one jot towards a knowledge of the
heart from which they proceeded. The impression
they are calculated to produce, is either that the Saint
was a self-conscious actor and pretender, or that they
are not her compositions. And the latter, perhaps,
may be considered the more probable hypothesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER PRAYERS.</div>

<p>Though addressed in form to the Deity, there is
little that can be accurately called prayer. The
speaker, or writer rather, seems continually to forget
his avowed object, and runs off into long statements
of the nature and attributes of the Deity, and ecclesiastical
propositions based thereon, evidently prompted
rather by didactic views on mortal hearers, than by
effort to hold communion with the Almighty. It is all
dry, cold, repetitive, verbose theology, instead of the
spontaneous warm utterances of either a thankful or a
contrite heart;&mdash;neither the expression of an earnest
spirit, nor the production of an eloquent writer.</p>

<p>There remain the letters, by far the most interesting
and valuable of the Saint's reputed works. They are
373 in number, and form two stout quarto volumes of
the Lucca edition. In the four octavo volumes of the
cheap Milan reprint before mentioned, only the first
198 are given; though there is no word of notice or
explanation to indicate, that the work is not complete.
On the contrary, the fourth volume is entitled "fourth
and last;" and we are left to the hopeful conjecture,
that the devout editors found the speculation so bad a
one commercially, that they thought fit to close the
publication suddenly, and leave their subscribers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
discover as late as might be, that they had purchased
an imperfect book.</p>

<p>The 373 letters of the entire collection have among
them many addressed to kings, popes, cardinals,
bishops, conventual bodies, and political corporations,
as well as a great number written to private individuals.
And it seems strange, that among so many correspondents
of classes, whose papers are likely to be
preserved, and many of whom, especially the monastic
communities, would assuredly have attached a high
value to such documents, no one original of any of
these letters should have been preserved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORIGINALS OF HER LETTERS.</div>

<p>Girolamo Gigli, the editor of the quarto edition of
the Saint's works, printed at Lucca and Siena, in
1707–13, an enthusiastic and laborious investigator
and collector of every description of information regarding
her, gives in his Preface to the letters, a careful
account of the manuscript collections from which
they have at different times been printed, but has not
a word to say of any scrap of original document.
"As soon," he writes, "as the saintly Virgin had
ascended to heaven in the year 1380, some of her
secretaries and disciples collected from one place and
another some of her letters and writings." But the
words which follow this seem to indicate that even
these earliest collectors did not possess any of the
original manuscripts, but made copies of them, in most
cases probably from other copies. "The blessed
Stefano Maconi," he says, "having transcribed the
book of the Dialogue, added at the end of it some
epistles; and another larger collection was made, also
by him as I think, in a certain volume which exists in
the library of the Certosa at Pavia. Buonconti also
collected not a few, as may be seen by an ancient copy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
in his writing, which was among the most notable
things left by the Cardinal Volunnio Bandinelli, and
now belongs to the Signor Volunnio, his nephew and
heir. We have another abundant collection in an
ancient manuscript preserved in the library of St.
Pantaleo at Rome; and this is one of the most faithful
of all those I have seen in its orthography and
style; and as far as can be judged by the character of
the writing, the scribe must have been contemporary
with the Saint. But the blessed Raymond of Capua,
her confessor, left to the Dominicans of Siena two
very large volumes of her letters neatly copied out on
parchment, in which nearly all those collected by the
others are contained. And these most precious documents
are rendered more valuable by the testimony
given to their authenticity by the blessed Tomaso
Caffarini in the above cited reports made at Venice."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The epistles were first printed by Aldus in 1500,
just 180 years after Catherine's death, and afterwards
in many other editions, all, according to Gigli, exceedingly
incorrect, and requiring much critical care both
in the restoration of the text to its original Tuscan
purity, and in the arrangement of the letters, as far as
possible, in their due chronological order. This, however,
is made subsidiary in Gigli's edition to a division
of them according to the persons to whom they were
addressed. Thus those to the two Popes, Gregory XI.
and Urban VI., come first; then those written to
cardinals; then those to bishops and other ecclesiastical
authorities; and lastly those to private
individuals.</p>

<p>And this is the substance of all the Sienese editor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
has to tell us respecting the texts, manuscript and
printed, on which his own has been formed. But the
Saint's confessor, and one or two of her disciples,
have recorded some circumstances respecting the lost
originals of these letters which require to be noticed.</p>

<p>It is stated in perfect accordance with all probability,
that Catherine had never learned to read or write, as
was in those days the case with the great majority of
women in stations of life far superior to her own. Her
biographer's account of her miraculously acquiring the
power of reading by sudden endowment has been
related in the preceding chapter. And at a later
period of her life we are told that she similarly
acquired the power of writing, "in order that she
might be able," writes Girolamo Gigli in his Preface to
the Letters, "to carry out the office of her apostolate
by more agencies than one, and in more places than
one, at the same time, Christ gave her by a wonderful
method the use of the pen, in the short schooling of a
trance, and by the teaching of St. John the Evangelist,
and of the blessed Doctor, Aquinas, as the Saint
herself affirms in a letter to the above-mentioned
blessed Raymond her confessor."</p>

<p>One of the most interesting points of inquiry in the
life of St. Catherine turns on the question, more fully
examined in a subsequent chapter, how far was she, or
was she not, entirely sincere in her statements and
pretensions. Now if she makes the statement attributed
to her respecting her acquisition of the art of writing,
it must be concluded that she was guilty of wilful
imposture. No possible self-deception could have
misled her as to the fact of her previous ignorance of
writing, and as little as to that of her writing after the
trance. It will be well therefore to observe accurately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
what she really does say herself upon the subject. In
1377, when she was in the thirtieth year of her age,
after her return from Avignon, and before her final
journey to Rome, she was inhabiting a villa belonging
to the noble Sienese family of Salimbeni, situated on an
isolated eminence overlooking the road to Rome, and
called "Rocca d'Orcia." Hence she wrote a very long
letter&mdash;the longest probably in the whole collection&mdash;occupying,
as it does, twelve full octavo pages&mdash;to
Father Raymond; and concludes it with the following
lines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER POWER OF WRITING.</div>

<p>"This letter, and another which I sent you, I have
written with my own hand from this isolated fortress,
with many sighs and abundance of tears, so that seeing
with my eyes, I did not see. But I was full of admiration
at myself, and at the goodness of God, considering
his mercy towards creatures, who have reason in them,
and his providence, which abounded upon me, giving
and providing me with the aptitude for writing for my
comfort, I having been deprived of that consolation,
which by reason of my ignorance I knew not. So that
on descending from the height (does this mean 'on
coming out of my trance,' or 'on leaving this fortress?')
I might have some little vent for the feelings
of my heart, so that it should not burst. Not being
willing to take me as yet out of this darksome life,
God formed it in my mind in a wonderful manner, as
the master does to the child, to whom he gives an
exemplar. So that, as soon as ever he was gone from
me, together with the glorious Evangelist John, and
Thomas Aquinas, sleeping I began to learn."</p>

<p>Now the entire value of this incident in the eyes of
the fourteenth, and the entire incredibility of it in the
eyes of the nineteenth century, and consequently its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
stringency as evidence against the sincerity of St.
Catherine, depends on the length of time intervening
between the moment when she began to learn in her
sleep, and that at which she first wrote. All her own
admiration of herself and of God's providence in the
matter, all her own belief in miracle, and her beginning
to learn in her sleep, we may admit without founding
thereon any impeachment of her sincerity. Nor need
we be accurate in taking the sense of her statement,
that she then <i>began</i> to learn. Most people would find
it difficult to say when they began to learn most
things. And on the other hand the phrase would seem
to express, that she did not <i>complete</i> her learning to
write in that same trance. We have other indications
also of a gradual advance in the art. The long letter,
in which the Saint makes the above statement, is
certainly not the first product of her new acquirement.
She speaks of having written a former letter to the
same correspondent. But neither was that her first
writing.</p>

<p>In the evidence given by the Beato Tomaso Caffarini
on the occasion of the examination of her pretensions
to canonization, he deposes: "I further testify, that I
heard from Master Stephen,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> of Siena," by means of
letters from him, how that this Virgin, after that she
miraculously learned to write, rising up from prayer
with a desire of writing, wrote with her own hand a
<i>little</i> letter (litterulam), which she sent to the said
Master Stephen, and in which was the following conclusion,
written, that is to say, in her own vernacular:
"Know, my son, that this is the first letter, which I
ever wrote;"&mdash;much such a first attempt as the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
unmiraculously taught of penmen might be likely to
make.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER FIRST PENMANSHIP.</div>

<p>Consistently then with all that Catherine distinctly
asserts on the subject, we may believe, that despite her
ready credence of her own environment with the supernatural
at every moment of her life, the only miracle
on the occasion of her newly acquired power of writing
was worked by that intensely strong will, which works
so many miracles in this world, and which all
Catherine's history shows her to have eminently
possessed.</p>

<p>The same witness further testifies that the above-mentioned
Stephen informed him that Catherine had
after that frequently written in his presence both letters
and some sheets of the book<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> she composed in the
vulgar tongue, all which writings he&mdash;Stephen&mdash;had
preserved in the Carthusian convent of Pontignano
near Siena, over which he presided. And there,
according to Girolamo Gigli, "they were known to have
been in existence for many years, until, not long ago,"
says he, writing in 1707, "they were transported to
Grenoble, at the time when the monks of Pontignano,
as well as all those of the Carthusian order, were
obliged to send all their papers to the Grande
Chartreuse." And so they vanish out of our sight.</p>

<p class="b1">Further Caffarini testifies, that he saw and had in
his own possession at Venice a prayer, written miraculously,
as he says, by Catherine, with a piece of
cinnabar, immediately on waking from a trance;
meaning, apparently, that trance, during which she
obtained the faculty of writing. He gives the prayer
in Latin prose. But Gigli says that it ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
written in the Tuscan as verse, in the manner in which
it is printed by Crescimbeni in the third volume of his
"Volgare Poesia," as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppa10">
"O Spirito santo, vieni nel mio cuore;<br />
Per la tua potenzia trailo a te, Dio:<br />
E concedemi carità con timore.<br />
Custodimi Christo da ogni mal pensiere,<br />
Riscaldami e rinfiammami del tuo dolcissimo amore,<br />
Sicchè ogni pena mi paja leggiere.<br />
Santo il mio padre, e dolce il mio Signore,<br />
Ora ajutami in ogni mio mestiere,<br />
Christo amore, Christo amore."<br />
</p>

<p class="p1">This writing, in cinnabar, Caffarini declares is
"now," 1411, in the Dominican nunnery at Venice.
But this also has shared the ill fortune which seems to
have attended every scrap of the Saint's writing. For
Gigli states that all his efforts to obtain any tidings of
it in his own time had been in vain.</p>

<p>A few other letters are recorded to have been written
by her own hand, especially one to Pope Urban. But
it is admitted, that the great bulk of the letters were
written by her secretaries, of whom she seems to have
kept three regularly employed, besides occasionally
using the assistance of several other of her companions
and disciples. A few of the letters are recorded to
have been dictated by her, when in a state of trance or
extasy; but there is nothing in either their matter or
manner to distinguish them from the rest. Whatever
may have been the true physical characteristics of these
trances, it is perfectly clear, that the mind which
dictated the letters in question, was pursuing the
habitual tenor of its daily thoughts, neither obscured
nor intensified by the condition of the body. They
are neither more nor less argumentative, neither more
nor less eloquent, than the others of the collection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
And it seems strange, that the same state of abstraction
from all bodily clog or guidance, which so often left
her mind impressionable by visions and hallucinations
having to her all the vivid reality of material events,
should on other occasions have been compatible with
the conduct of mental operations, in no respect
differing from those of her ordinary waking state.
But it is to be observed, that the authority on which
it is stated, that these letters were dictated by the
Saint in a state of extasy, is only that of her amanuenses;
and that, admitting them to have been of perfect
good faith in the matter, nothing is more probable,
than that, all agape, as they were ever for fresh wonders,
and evidences of Saintship, any trifling circumstance,
such as long continuance in the same attitude, or closed
eyes, may have been considered sufficient evidence of
trance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER LITERARY MERITS.</div>

<p>The very high reputation, and that not altogether of
a pietistic or ecclesiastical nature, which this large
mass of writings has enjoyed for several centuries has
appeared to the present writer an extremely singular
fact. It will justify him however in occupying some
pages, and the reader's attention with a translation<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of
one of the most esteemed of the collection. Be it
what it may, it can hardly be otherwise than interesting
to any reader to see a specimen of compositions, said
to have produced so widely spread and important
results, and praised by so many men of note; and the
means, which it will give him of comparing his
impressions of it with those of the writer, will in some
degree lessen the diffidence with which the latter must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
express an opinion wholly at variance with so large a
quantity of high authority.</p>

<p>A great deal of the praise bestowed on St. Catherine's
writings by Italian critics has reference to their style
and diction. Written at a time when the language,
fresh from the hands of Dante, of Petrarch, and of
Boccaccio, was still in its infancy, and in a city in all
times celebrated for the purity of its vernacular, they
have by the common consent of Italian scholars
taken rank as one of the acknowledged classics of the
language;&mdash;"testa di lingua," as the Tuscan purists
say. The Della Cruscans have placed them on the
jealously watched list of their authorities; and an
enthusiastic Sienese compatriot has compiled a "vocabalario
Caterineano," after the fashion of those consecrated
to the study of the works of Homer and
Cicero. Of course no one from the barbarous side of
the Alps can permit themselves any word of observation
on this point. Had no such decisive opinion been
extant to guide his ignorance, it might probably have
seemed to a foreigner, that the Saint's style was loose
in its syntax, intricate in its construction, and overloaded
with verbosity. But we are bound to suppose,
that any such opinion could be formed only by one
ignorant of the real beauties of the language: especially
as we know how great and minute is the attention paid
to diction by Italian critics.</p>

<p>But these philological excellences are after all the
least part of the praise that has been lavished on
Catherine as an author. Her admirers enlarge on the
moving eloquence, the exalted piety, the noble sentiments,
the sound argumentation of her compositions,
especially her letters. And it is not from an Italian,
or a Dominican, but from a French Jesuit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
historian, Papire Masson, that we have the following
enthusiastic praise of that letter more especially,
which it is intended to submit to the reader of these
pages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER LETTER TO CHARLES V.</div>

<p>"Several epistles are extant," writes this sixteenth
century Frenchman, "from Catherine of Siena to
Urban, and one to King Charles V., written on
the 6th of May, 1379, to uphold that Pope's cause.
And certainly nothing more weighty or more elegant
could have been conceived or written by any man of
that time, not even excepting Petrarch, whose genius
I admire, and whose works I generally prefer to those
of any other writer of that age."</p>

<p>To the present writer such an opinion appears
perfectly monstrous, and wholly unaccountable on any
simply literary consideration of the matter. It may
be admitted to be no little extraordinary that a poor
dyer's daughter in the fourteenth century should write
these letters, such as they are; that she should possess
so much knowledge of the general state of Church
politics in Europe, as they evince; and most of all
that having popes, kings, and cardinals for her correspondents,
she should be listened to by them with
respect and attention. Even to the Pope, she on more
than one occasion ventures on a tone of very decided
reproof; and it should seem, that Urban VI., a choleric
and violent tempered man, received from her in
good part communications couched in language such as
rarely reaches Papal ears. "The blessed Christ," she
says, in writing to Urban of the vices of the ecclesiastics,
a topic to which she returns again and again,
"complains of this, that his Church is not swept clean
of vices, and your Holiness has not that solicitude on
the subject which you ought to have." Again, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
there had been riots in Rome, in consequence of the
Pope having failed to keep certain promises he had
made to the people, she "humbly begs him to take
care, prudently to promise only what it will be possible
for him to perform in its entirety."</p>

<p>All this is curious enough, and abundantly sufficient
to prove that Catherine was an influential power in
her generation. It will be the business of a following
chapter to offer some suggestions as to the explanation
of this remarkable fact. But let the causes of it have
been what they may, it is difficult to suppose that they
can be found in the persuasive eloquence, or literary
merit of her appeals to those in power.</p>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">CATHERINE'S LETTER TO THE KING OF FRANCE.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The letter selected as a specimen of the vast mass
of the Saint's correspondence is perhaps the most
specially celebrated of the whole collection. It was to
Charles V. of France, on the 6th of May, 1379, on the
subject of the favour shown by him to the party of the
Anti-pope Clement VII., and runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dearest father in sweet Christ Jesus, I Catherine
the slave of the servants of Jesus Christ, write to you
in his precious blood, with the desire to see in you<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> a
true and entirely perfect light, in order that you may
know the truth of that which is necessary to you for
your salvation. Without this light, we shall go into
darkness; darkness which will not permit us to discern
that which is hurtful to the soul and to the body, from
that which is useful to us; and thus destroys the perceptions
of the soul, so that good things are made to
seem bad, and bad things good, that is to say, vice.
And those things, which lead us to sin, appear to us
good and delightful; and virtue, and that which leads
us to virtue, appears to us bitter and of great difficulty.
But he, who has light, knows well the truth; and
accordingly loves virtue, and God, who is the cause of
all virtue; and hates vice, and his own sensuality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
which is the cause of all vice. What is it, that takes
from us this true and sweet light? The self-love
which a man has for his own self, which is a cloud
that obscures the eye of the intellect, and hides from
the pupil the light of the most holy faith. And thus a
man goes as one blind and ignorant, following his own
frailty, wholly given up to passion, without the light
of reason, even as an animal, which, because it has no
reasoning powers, allows itself to be guided by its own
sensations. Great pity is it that man, whom God has
created in his own image and likeness, should voluntarily
by his own fault make himself worse than the
brute animal, that like an ungrateful and ignorant
creature, neither knows nor acknowledges the benefits
of God, but attributes them to himself. From self-love
proceeds every evil. Whence come injustice, and all
the other faults? From self-love. It commits injustice
against God, against itself, against its neighbour, and
against Holy Church. Against God it commits injustice,
in that it does not render glory and praise to his
name, as it ought to do. To itself it does not render
hatred and dislike of vice, and love of virtue; nor to
its neighbour benevolence; and if it is found in a
ruler, it does not do justice to its neighbour, because
it does so<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> only according to the pleasure of human
creatures, or for its own natural pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Nor to
the Church does it render obedience, or assistance, but
continually persecutes it. All is caused by self-love,
which does not permit a man to know the truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
because he is deprived of light. This is very manifest
to us, and we see it, and have proofs in ourselves every
day that it is so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER LETTER TO CHARLES V.</div>

<p>"I would not, dearest father, that this cloud should
take the light from you; but I wish that there should
be in you that light, which is able to make you know
and discern the Truth. It appears to me, from what
I hear, that you begin to allow yourself to be guided by
the counsel of evil men; and you know, that if one
blind one leads another, both fall into the ditch. So
will it happen to you, if you do not find some better
remedy than what I hear of. It is a matter of great
wonder to me, that a Catholic man, who is willing to
fear God, and to be manlike, should let himself be
guided like a child, and should not see how he leads
himself and others into so great ruin, as is the contaminating
the light of the most Holy Faith according
to the word and counsel of those whom we see to be
members of the devil, corrupt trees, whose faults are
manifest to us by the poison of heresy they have
recently disseminated, saying that Pope Urban VI.
is not truly Pope. Open the eye of your mind,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and
see that they lie in their throats,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> may be put to
confusion by their own showing, and be seen to be
worthy of heavy punishment, from whatever side we
turn ourselves. If we turn to those, who, as they say,
elected Urban Pope from fear of the fury of the people,
they say what is not the truth, since they, in the first
instance, had elected him by an election so canonical
and orderly, that never was any other supreme pontiff so
elected. They in truth gave out, that they proceeded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
elect for fear the people should rise, but not that from
this fear they elected Bartholomew, Archbishop of
Bari, who is now Urban VI. And this much I confess
is the truth, and do not deny it. He whom they
elected by fear was the Cardinal of St. Peter,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> as is
evident to every one; but the election of Pope Urban
was made in a legitimate manner, as has been said.
This election they announced to you, and to us, and
to the other rulers of the world, manifesting by their
deeds, that which they told us in words, doing reverence
to him, that is to say, adoring him as Christ on
earth, and crowning him with all solemnity, and by
remaking anew the election with great unanimity.
From him, as from the supreme Pontiff, they besought
favours, and used them. And if it were not true that
Urban is Pope, but that he has been elected under the
constraint of fear, would not they be worthy eternally
of confusion? That the pillars of Holy Church, set
up for the spreading of the faith, should for fear of
bodily death, be willing to consign themselves and us
to eternal death, by showing us as our father one who
was not so. And would they not be thieves, taking
and using<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> that which they had no right to use?
Indeed, if that were true, which they now say, as true
it is not, still Urban VI. is truly Pope. But fools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and blinded madmen as they are, they have shown
and given to us this truth, and hold a lie for themselves.
This truth they confessed so long as his
Holiness delayed to correct their vices. But as soon
as he began to attack them, and to show that their
wicked mode of life was displeasing to him, and that
he was minded to put an end to it, they immediately
raised their heads. And against whom have they
raised them? Against the holy faith. They have
acted worse than renegade Christians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER LETTER TO CHARLES V.</div>

<p>"Oh! miserable men! They and those who follow
them know not their own ruin; for if they knew it,
they would seek the Divine aid; they would acknowledge
their fault, and not be obstinate as the devils,
as devils they in truth appear, and have taken on them
the office of such. The office of the devils is to pervert
souls from Christ crucified, to withdraw them
from the way of the truth, to lead them into lies, and
to gather them through pain and through punishment
to himself, who is the father of lies, giving them that
fate which he has for himself. In like manner these
men go subverting the truth which they themselves
have given us; and returning to lies, have introduced
division into the whole world. And that evil which
they have in themselves, that they propose to us.
Have we the will to know thoroughly this truth? Let
us look now and consider their life and conduct, and
what following they have of themselves, who are
followers of the vestiges of iniquity; since one devil
is not contrary to another, but on the contrary they
agree together. And pardon me, dearest father (for
such I will consider you, as long as I see you to be a
lover of truth, and confounder of lies), for I speak thus,
because grief for the damnation of them and of others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and the desire I have for their salvation, causes me to
do so. I say this not in disparagement of them, as
God's creatures, but in disparagement of vice and of
the heresy which they have sown throughout the
world, and of the cruelty of which they are guilty
towards themselves, and towards the humble souls
that perish by their means, for which they must give
an account to the Supreme Judge. For if they had
been men having the fear of God, or if not the fear of
God, respect for the opinion of the world, they would
patiently have borne the worst that Pope Urban could
have done to them, or even greater contumely, and
would have preferred a thousand deaths to doing what
they have done; for to greater shame they cannot come,
than to appear to the eyes of mankind schismatics,
and heretical despisers of the holy faith. If I look to
spiritual and corporeal loss, I see them by heresy
deprived of God as regards his mercies, and in the
body reasonably deprived of their dignities; and they
themselves have done it. If I look to the Divine
judgment I see it close upon them, if they do not lift
themselves out of this darkness; for every fault is
punished, and every good deed is rewarded. It will
be hard for them to kick against God, if they possessed
the greatest possible human power. God is the
supreme strength, which fortifies the weak who confide
and trust in Him. And it is the truth; and the truth
is that which makes us free. We see that only the
truth of the servants of God follows,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and holds this
truth of Pope Urban VI., confessing him to be truly
Pope, as he is. You will not find a servant of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
who <i>is</i> a servant of God, that holds the contrary.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> I
do not speak of such as wear outside the garment of
lambs, but inside are ravenous wolves. And do you
suppose that, if this were not the truth, God would
endure that His servants should walk in such darkness?
He would not endure it. If He endures it in the
wicked men of the world, He would not endure it in
them; and therefore He has given them the light of
His truth, for He is no despiser of holy desires
but is the accepter of them, like a kind and merciful
Father as He is. I would that you would call to you
such men as these, and cause them to declare this
truth to you; and that you would not choose to walk
so ignorantly. Let not your private interest move
you; for that would be worse in you than in any other.
Have pity on the many souls which you cast into the
hands of the devils. If you will not do good, at least
do not evil; for evil frequently turns more to the hurt
of him who does it, than of him whom the doer of it
wishes to injure. So much evil comes of it, that by it
we lose the grace of God, temporal wealth is consumed,
and the death of men follows from it. Alas me! And
it does not seem that we<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> see the light; for the cloud
of self-love has taken from us the light, and does not
let us see. For this reason we are apt to receive any
evil information, that may be given to us against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
truth by lovers of themselves. But if we have the
light it will not be so; but with great prudence and
holy fear of God, you would be willing to know and
investigate this truth by means of men of conscience
and knowledge. If you choose, ignorance need not
fall upon you, since you have where you are the fountain
of knowledge,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> which I fear you may lose if you
continue in your present course; and you know well
how your kingdom will fare, if they shall be men of
good consciences, who will not follow a human will
with servile fear, but will maintain the truth. They
will declare it to you, and will put your mind and soul
at rest. Now act not so any more, most dear Father!
consult your own conscience; think that you must die,
and that you know not when; put before the eye of
your intellect, God and his truth, and not interest, or
love of country; for as regards God, we ought not to
make any difference between one country and another,
since we all proceed from His holy mind, are created
in His image and likeness, and redeemed by the
precious blood of His only-begotten Son. I am certain
that if you have light you will do this, and will not
wait for time, for time does not wait for you; and will
invite them<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> to return to their holy and true obedience,
but otherwise not. And for this reason I said that I
desired to see in you a true and perfect light, in order
that with the light you may recognise and love and
fear the truth. My soul will then be made happy by
your safety, at seeing you come out from so great an
error. I say to you nothing further. Remain in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
holy and sweet love of God. Pardon me if I have been
too heavy on you with my words. My desire for your
safety urges me to say them to you by my mouth in
your<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> presence, rather than by writing. May God
fill you with His most sweet grace. Jesus is sweet;

<div class="sidenote">HER LETTER TO CHARLES V.</div>

<p>Such is the composition pronounced to be unsurpassed
for weight of reasoning and eloquence, and to
be equal to the writings of Petrarch! Can it be supposed
that, putting out of the question any influence
exercised by the character of the writer, any human
mind was ever persuaded to do or to think anything
by such an address? As argument it is surely worse
than in any other point of view. With the exception
of the passage pointing out the insincerity of the
cardinals who raised objections to the election of
Urban, there were perhaps never strung together so
many absurdly glaring instances of begging the question.
And as for rhetorical power, surely in this
waste of pleonastic phrases, redundant tautology, and
trite common-place hack-preacher's topics, there is no
faintest trace even of that untaught eloquence which
strong feeling and earnest conviction are apt to
command.</p>

<p>And yet looking at the matter in hand from the
fourteenth century point of view, what a subject it
was to call forth an awful and heart-stirring appeal!
If a true Pope be anything, how tremendous and
infinitely horrible a phenomenon must an Anti-pope
be. Think of the adulteration of the infallible with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
fallible, of the doubts engendered, where certainty is
imperatively needed, of the sacraments nullified, and
the one half of sacred Christendom cheated into
eternal perdition, as the necessary result of void
ordinations, void baptisms, and void absolutions, and
think for a moment how Petrarch, or still better how
Dante, would have written on such a subject!</p>

<p>But Catherine must have sincerely believed that
her utterances were the utterances of inspiration, and
must necessarily have effect as such. For that she
bestowed on this long and important letter none of the
ordinary care and labour which such a composition
would naturally claim from a merely human author, is
curiously shown by the record which has preserved the
fact, that the Saint dictated three other long letters on
the same 6th of May on which she composed this! It
is recorded also that she occasionally dictated as many
as three letters to three secretaries at the same time.
Her biographer and commentators consider the excessive
outpouring of words one of the most remarkable
proofs of her supernatural claims and powers. And
more sceptical minds may admit it as at least a proof
of wonderful energy, and indomitable strength of
volition.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center p1 mid">DUPE OR IMPOSTOR?</p>

<p class="pn p2">The official accredited story of this undoubtedly
extraordinary and exceptional woman contains, as has
been sufficiently seen, a large number of statements,
which probably every reader of these pages will, without
hesitation, pronounce to be false. Many of the
events stated to have happened undoubtedly never did
happen; but the question will still remain, how large
a portion of the tale must be deemed fraudulent
fiction by those who cannot believe things to have
happened which contradict the known laws of nature.
And when this shall have been answered as satisfactorily
as may be under the difficult circumstances of
the investigation, it will yet remain to be decided <i>who</i>
is to be deemed to have been guilty of fraud.</p>

<p>Before entering on these questions; it may be just
suggested to the reader,&mdash;as a caution to be borne in
mind, not as a point intended to be dwelt on in considering
the matter,&mdash;that we are perhaps not altogether
so well aware what <i>are</i> the laws of nature in the case
of persons afflicted as Catherine was, as some of us
are apt to imagine.</p>

<p>Looking at the matter, however, from the most
ordinary points of view, it may perhaps be found, that
as regards Catherine herself, it is not so necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
consider her an impostor, as it may at first sight of
the matter appear.</p>

<p>Of the austerities, mortifications, and abstinences
recounted, all perhaps may be admitted to have been
possible,&mdash;especially bearing in mind that Catherine's
life was neither a long nor a healthy one&mdash;except the
fasting for years, and the sleeping only one quarter-of-an-hour
per diem. As to the fasting, it is mentioned
incidentally in another part of Father Raymond's book,
that she was sustained only by the sacramental bread,
which she seems to have been in the habit of taking
daily. May it not be possible, that the idea of her
living without food, may have been generated by some
talk of hers, in quite her usual strain, of this Holy
Eucharist being her only nourishment, etc., etc.,
meaning spiritual nourishment? But then was Father
Raymond deceived by any such expressions? Did he
really believe that she lived for years without taking
food? For in his account, no mistake of meaning is
possible. He, at all events, intends his readers to
believe the simple fact in its naked absurdity.</p>

<p>As for the sleep, it maybe remarked that in the case
of a person subject to daily trances and states of
insensibility, it is very difficult to say how many hours
are passed in sleep, and what is sleep, and what not.</p>

<p>In the next place, all the relations of visions seen
in "extasy," and of conversations held, and sensations
suffered during them, may&mdash;due consideration being
given to what we know of the patient&mdash;be accepted as
not only possible but exceedingly probable. And this
category will comprise the greatest part of the whole
budget of wonders. Even in those cases, in which an
abiding evidence of what had happened to her in
trance is said to have remained appreciable only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
her own senses, as in the case of the marriage ring,
and the pain after the infliction of the stigmata; those
most able to form an opinion on such matters, will not
think, probably, that it is attributing too much to the
imagination of a cataleptic patient, living on raw
vegetables, wholly without active occupation, and
engrossed by a series of highly exciting thoughts on
one ever-present subject of a mystical and transcendental
nature, to suppose that she may have in all
sincerity imagined herself to see and to feel as she
described.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF MIRACLES.</div>

<p>Of many of the miracles, including some of those
most insisted on and boasted of by her biographer,&mdash;as
for instance of the restoration of her mother to life,&mdash;a
natural explanation, not necessarily involving any
intentional falsehood, is so obvious, as to need no
pointing. And others may, without any great improbability,
be referred to mistake, inaccuracy, or exaggeration.
On the whole, I do not think that the evidence
constrains us to convict Catherine of falsehood or
imposture in her miraculous pretensions. The impression
of her innocence of this cannot, however, I think,
be stated in any more forcible form. Few persons,
probably, will obtain from an impartial consideration
of the story, any satisfactory conviction that she
was wholly sincere. We find her guilty of falsehood
to her mother at an early period of her life, when she
represents herself as frequenting certain hot baths with
a different purpose than the real one, which was to
burn herself by their heat, as a means of discounting
eternal burning hereafter. This deception is related
by her confessor as a holy and praiseworthy act. And
the whole tenor of his morality, and of that of the
school to which he belongs, forbids the idea, that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
high reverence for truth, as truth, formed any part of
their teaching. There is nothing in all we know of
Catherine, either from her own writings, or from those
of her biographer, to indicate that her spiritual conceptions,
religious system, or theory of morals, differed
in any respect from the standard orthodoxy of her time
and country. We find no more elevated notions of
Deity, no saner views of duty, no nobler beau-ideal of
human excellence. Her history may be regarded as
the culminating expression of the ascetic divinity
of that age. She lived wholly surrounded by, and
devoted (very literally) body and soul, to a fiercely
fanatical community, eager and conscientiously bound
to advance their system and the glory of their order
by all and every means. Their thoughts were her
thoughts, their interests her interests, and their views
of all things in heaven and earth, her views. And it
must be admitted, that these considerations make it
very difficult to suppose, that she would have felt the
least scruple in lending herself to any scheme of pious
fraud, which might appear calculated to promote the
"glory of God," and of the order of St. Dominic. If
she could have felt any such scruple, she assuredly
would have been far in advance of the moral theories
and feelings of her day; and this, as has been seen,
there is every reason to think that she was not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FATHER RAYMOND'S INSINCERITY.</div>

<p>The same consideration of the story, as it has been
handed down to us, which, despite the suspicion that
a pupil of Father Raymond and the Dominicans of
the fourteenth century could not have had any very
strict ideas of the sacredness of truth, leads us nevertheless
to believe it more probable that Catherine was
no conscious impostor, by no means points to the same
conclusion respecting the monk, her biographer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
confessor. Of course he could have had no means of
ascertaining the reality of the visions she represented
herself to be in the daily habit of seeing, beyond the
natural probabilities of the case. And it is likely
enough, that the cataleptic trances and convulsions
witnessed by him, may have appeared to him, as to
the generality of his contemporaries, the signs and
consequences of supernatural communion with, and
especial favour of, heaven. But there remain other
portions of the narrative, in which facts are stated as
having occurred within the writer's knowledge, which
he must have known to be untrue. He could not have
been deceived into supposing that Catherine lived for
many years without food, though her own expressions
on the subject, as has been pointed out, may have been
equivocal. In one passage of her letters, referred to
as containing authority of her own for the statement,
the Saint, in speaking of the bodily sufferings she had
recently endured, says that her body remained without
food. But she says no word to indicate how long her
fast lasted, and the reference is clearly a dishonest one.</p>

<p>Among the vast number of miracles related, it is
difficult to find cases on which a charge of wilful fraud
against the Dominican biographer can be safely pressed
to conviction. In so many instances mistake may
have been possible. In so many others, whatever he
may have been inclined to believe in his own heart, he
had no means of testing with certainty the truth of
her statements to him; and, therefore, cannot be
<i>convicted</i> of falsehood for repeating them. He <i>may</i> have
believed them to be real facts. But one case of fair
conviction is enough; and that we have in the statement
of the total abstinence from food for many years.
It should seem then, that although we may acquit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Catherine of conscious deception, we must believe her
confessor,&mdash;the Barnum, who "brought out" the
wonder, introduced her to the world, and reaped the
profit of her,&mdash;to be a rogue and impostor.</p>

<p>Such a subject as this enthusiastic strong-willed
cataleptic girl, was a rare and most valuable catch for
the Dominican Order, and was to be turned to the
best account accordingly. A real producible miracle-working
Saint, who did veritably pass daily into a
state of rapt extasy, and whose excitable and diseased
brain was in that state ever prompt to impose on her
imagination as realities whatever phantasmagoria of
hallucinations her ghostly instructors chose to ply her
waking fancy with, was a treasure calculated to bring
much grist, spiritual as well as temporal, to the
Dominican mill. In that remarkable case of the
stigmata, which so admirably supplied the sons of St.
Dominick with exactly what they needed, to enable
them to hold their own against the rival Order of the
Stigmatised St. Francis, how readily may be conceived
the sort of conversation and suggestions, which must
have prepared the mind of Catherine to reproduce the
miracle for them as soon as her infirmity should set free
her imagination from the world of reality!</p>

<p>And this capability of being played upon, rendered
her, it is to be observed, a far more valuable instrument
in the hands of those who touched the keys
than if she had been a mere accomplice of imposture.
Such an every-day cheat would hardly have accomplished
the feats, and held the position, which are the
most remarkable facts in this strange story, and which
present an enigma, that requires some examination in
the closing chapter of it.</p>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center p1 mid">THE SECRET OF HER INFLUENCE.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The recent reprint, and large circulation of the
"Legend" and Letters of St. Catherine, give a present
interest to her story, which it would otherwise want,
and indicate but too clearly, that her influence is not a
mere thing of the past, but a living and active fact.
But the causes and nature of this influence are far from
being a secret to those who have paid any attention to
the present condition of Italy, and who understand the
<i>modus operandi</i>, and policy of a church, the whole
purpose, scope, and meaning of whose being, is the
preservation of its own existence, and that of the
sovereigns, its partners and accomplices in the subjugation
and plundering of the people. And the direct
and indirect uses of Saintly literature towards this end,
however well worthy of being studied, form no proper
part of the present subject. The influence, far more
difficult to be accounted for, which Catherine cannot
be denied to have exercised over Popes and Kings, her
contemporaries, is what should be here explained, as
far as any explanation can be found for it.</p>

<p>That none such must be sought in the literary
qualities of her writings, has probably been made
sufficiently manifest. When every allowance has been
made for the intellectual difference, which may be
supposed to exist between a fourteenth century and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
nineteenth century reader, it still remains incredible,
that such missives, as that above translated from the
Saint's Italian, should, irrespectively of any otherwise
manifested claims of the sender of them, have been
found powerfully persuasive by those to whom they
were addressed. We have no proof, indeed, that this
especial letter did produce any effect on the King of
France. And with regard to the letters written to
Urban, after the breaking out of the schism, it may be
argued, that, whatever he may have privately thought
of Catherine's pretensions and powers, he was no doubt
too well aware of the importance an enthusiastic, well
accredited Saint, might be of to his party, to think of
throwing cold water on her zeal and exertions. The
success of her mission to Avignon, however, and the
employment of her intercession with the Pope by the
rulers of Florence, testify abundantly to the esteem in
which she was held.</p>

<p>Can it be supposed, that the wide-spread reputation
she acquired, and the marvellous power she exercised,
were derived from the impression made on her contemporaries
by her virtues, the purity of her life, the
earnestness of benevolence, and the zeal of her charity?
But that would be to attribute to mere goodness a
power over one of the most corrupt generations in the
history of the world, which it has never been seen
able to exert over any age. It would be to attribute to
the virtue of Catherine a triumph, which the infinitely
more perfect virtue of One infinitely greater than she
failed to achieve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER MORAL NATURE.</div>

<p>Of all possible solutions this would be the least
compatible with the conditions of the age in which she
lived. But the low morality, to which mere purity
of life would have appealed in vain, was especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
favourable to the powerful and successful operation of
another class of the Saint's pretensions. In proportion
as the intellectual and moral darkness of men make a
spiritual conception of Deity more and more impossible
to them, are they prone in the desolation of their unacknowledged,
but none the less effective atheism, to accept
with ready awe and reverential fear any such gross
material manifestations, as profess to reveal to them
a God sufficiently ungodly not to be disturbingly out
of place in their scheme of life and eternity. Those
"ages of faith," therefore, whose title to that appellation
consists in their eager readiness to accept and believe
any quantity of such miracles as could be conceived to
proceed only from the will of a God created in the
likeness of a very unspiritual man, were probably as
little faithful to any spiritually profitable ideal of the
Divine nature, as any generations since the dawn of
Christianity.</p>

<p>To such ages Catherine was admirably adapted
to appeal with remarkable force and success. Her
strength of will, and her infirmity of body, both
contributed to produce the effect to be explained.
The first, as evidenced by the unflinchingly persevering
infliction of self-torments, such as would have
been wholly intolerable to a weaker will, and by
continued exertion under suffering, weakness, and
malady, made a large and important part of the saintly
character; as the same qualities differently evidenced
would have led to eminence in any career, and in any
age. But joined to this potent strength of will may be
observed evidences of a very remarkable degree of
spiritual egotism, and "the pride that apes humility."
The poor Sienese dyer's daughter must have been one
of those rare natures, to whom the quiet obscure career<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
marked out for them, as it might seem, irrevocably by
the circumstances of their birth, was an intolerable
impossibility. A woman, poor, plebeian, unlettered,
frail in health, and in the fourteenth century! Surely
no possible concatenation of circumstances could be
devised, from which it would appear so impossible
to emerge into power and celebrity! But the "<i>Io
Caterina schiava dei servi di Dio</i>," of the letters, who
thinks that entire nations shall be accepted or rejected
as reprobate by the Eternal in accordance with the
measure of <span class="smcap">HER</span> merits or demerits, and who bargains
with God to bear in <span class="smcap">HER</span> own person the sacrilegious
sin of a whole revolted people!&mdash;this Caterina was one
whom no position could doom to the obscurity intolerable
to such idiosyncrasies. And she rushed forth
with uncontrollable determination on the one only
path open to her;&mdash;not by any means necessarily with
the conscious intention of making hypocritical use of
the profession of sanctity for the achievement of distinction;
but driven by the unrecognised promptings
of ambition to the determination to excel in the
department of human endeavour, which all contemporary
opinion pointed out to her, as the highest,
holiest, and noblest, open to mankind.</p>

<p>But the peculiar infirmity to which she was subject
contributed a part of her extraordinary adaptability to
the career she was to run, fully as important as any
of the elements of strength in her character. Not only
did her frequent cataleptic trances obtain from the
people the most unhesitating belief in her supernatural
communion with God, and in the miraculous visions
which she related, in all probability with perfect sincerity,
as having taken place therein; but they had as
powerful a subjective as an objective effect. The Saint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
arose from each of these abnormal conditions of
existence, nerved for fresh endurance, armed with
increased pretensions, and animated with renewed
enthusiasm, the result of hallucinations produced by
the intensity of her waking wishes, imaginations, and
aspirations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DOMINICAN ORDER.</div>

<p>To these fortunately combined elements of success
must be added a third, perhaps hardly less essential to
it than either. Catherine, with her equally valuable
and rare gifts and infirmities, fell from the outset of
her career into hands well skilled and well able to
make the most of them. She was from the beginning
a devoted member of the great Order of St. Dominick;
and it may be doubted on which side lies the balance
of obligation between the Saint and her order. If she
was to them a fruitful source of credit, profit, and
power, they afforded her a status, worldly-wisdom, and
backing, without which she could not have attained
the position she did. She had for her confessor and
special adviser one whom we must suppose to have
been the most notable man among the Dominicans
of his time, inasmuch as he became their General.
And we have seen enough of this able monk in his
quality of Saint-leader, to authorise the belief, that he
was quite ready to supply as much of the wisdom of
the serpent, as might be needed to bring to a good
working alloy the Saint's dove-like simplicity. In what
exact proportions the metal was thus run, that was
brought to bear on the Popes and other great people
so strangely influenced by Catherine, it is impossible
to say. But there will be little danger of error in
concluding, that the effect of either ingredient solely
would not have been the same.</p>

<p>Finally, should it still seem difficult to believe, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
two fourteenth century Popes, one a mild Frenchman,
and the other an overbearing and choleric Italian,
should have accepted the Sienese Virgin as a special
messenger from Heaven, have really credited her
miraculous pretensions, and have accorded a respect
to her epistles on the score of their being inspired
(which they assuredly would not have yielded to them
as simply human compositions), it may be suggested,
that men placed in the position of those Popes may
possibly not have sincerely believed all that they
deemed it politic to seem to believe. The miracle-working
Saint, who came with such a man as Father
Raymond to prompt her, backed by all the power and
interest of the Dominican Order, with the ambassadorial
credentials of the revolted and dangerous
community of Florence in her hand, and with almost
unlimited power of moving and directing the passions
of large masses of the populace, was not a personage
to be set at nought by a prudent Pontiff in the position
of either Gregory XI. or Urban VI.</p>

<p>The history of Catherine's Saintship since her
canonisation has been too much the same, as that
of all her brethren and sisters of the calendar, to make
it at all interesting to enter into details of the "<i>dulia</i>"&mdash;not
worship! observe Protestant reader!&mdash;offered to
her. She has her chapels, her relics, her candles, her
office, her day, her devotees, like the rest of Rome's
holy army. But what she could not be permitted to
have, despite the recognition of Urban VIII., in 1628,
was a claim to blood-relationship with the noble family
of Borghese. Whether the Saint's heraldic backers
were correct in attributing to her such an honour, or
those of the Borghese right in disputing the fact, it
is clear that that remarkably noble family had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
sufficient respect for saintly reputation, however exalted,
to endure that a dyer's daughter, let her have been
what she might, should mar by her vicinity the
nobleness of the many barbarous barons and worthless
knights who have borne the family name. So great
was the outcry they raised, that Urban VIII. was
obliged infallibly to unsay his previous saying on the
subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANECDOTE OF THE PRESENT POPE.</div>

<p>By way of a conclusion, which, while it shows, that
in the case of Catherine at least, there is an exception
to the rule that excludes a prophet from honour in his
own country, proves also that the subject of her Saintship
is not a matter of mere historical interest, but
aspires to the dignity of an "actualité," an anecdote
may be told of the present Pope's recent journey
through Tuscany.</p>

<p>Arrived at Siena, he too, like his predecessors, either
thought it holy, or thought it politic, to pay due
attention to the popular Saint in her own city. He
accordingly directed the Saint's head, in its setting of
silver and precious stones, to be brought from the
Dominican church to his lodging in the Grand-ducal
palace. But the populace of the city, especially the
women of the ward in which the Saint was born,
estimated the value of the precious relic so much more
highly than they did the honesty of the Pontiff, that
they insisted on not losing sight of their treasure, and
could hardly be persuaded that Pio Nono had no
burglarious intentions respecting it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pbqc">Of Catherine's father, the Duke, and of his magnificent journey to
Florence.</p>


<p class="pn p2">The latter years of the fifteenth century, up to 1494,
were a time of unusual prosperity in Italy. Never
since the fall of the Roman empire, one thousand
years previously, says Guicciardini,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> had she enjoyed a
period so flourishing and happy. "Reposing in perfect
peace and tranquillity," continues the great historian,
"cultivated in the more sterile and mountainous regions,
as well as in the plains and fertile districts, subject to
none save her native rulers, she not only abounded
with inhabitants, trade, and wealth, but was especially
adorned by the magnificence of a great number of
princes, by the splendour of many noble and beautiful
cities, by the majesty of the supreme seat of religion,
and by the excellence of her great men in every art,
pursuit, and science."</p>

<p>Of these noble and wealthy cities, Milan was one of
the noblest and wealthiest; and Galeazzo Maria
Sforza, its Duke, was one of the princes who most
notably "adorned Italy with his magnificence." The
Visconti had reigned there from 1277, till the death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Filippo, the last Duke of that race, in 1447, without
heirs male. He had, some years before his death, given
his daughter Bianca, and the succession to his duchy,
to the celebrated soldier of fortune Francesco Sforza.
And the magnificent Galeazzo, whose lot fell on the
halcyon times described by Guicciardini, was the son
of Francesco and Bianca, and succeeded his father in
1466.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOHN PETER LANDRIANO.</div>

<p>Now, in the smiling and happy city of Milan, in
these merry days of the good old time, there lived,
eating his polenta, paying church-dues and taxes, and
so pursuing, as quietly as he might, his way to dusty
death among a crowd bound for the same bourne, a
citizen named John Peter Landriano. To this John
Peter, also, it might have been permitted to sleep in
tranquil oblivion together with the others of his probably
polenta-eating, and certainly tax-paying, fellow-citizens,
instead of being still, after now four hundred
years, thus extant, despite his "fallentis semita vitæ,"
had not Mnemosyne marked him for her own, by right
of one small fact. He was the husband of a remarkably
beautiful wife, named somewhat unhappily Lucretia,
on whom it pleased his magnificent Highness
Galeazzo Maria to look with condescension in the year
1462. In a later part of that same year, the family
of John Peter Landriano was increased by the birth of
a female child, named Catherine, whom his Highness
was so good as to consider and educate as his own.</p>

<p>This splendid prince, who was, as Catherine's priestly
biographer,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Burriel, informs us, more bookishly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
inclined than could have been expected from a person
of his exalted rank, took care that her education should
be sedulously attended to by some of the learned persons
who abounded in his court. And he had reason
to be so well contented with the promise of her early
years, that shortly after she had reached the age of
eight, he caused her to be "legitimatised "&mdash;a curious
process, which would seem to prove that, though not
Jove himself has power o'er the past, Holy Mother
Church possesses it.</p>

<p>Thenceforward Catherine's education was conducted
under the superintendence of the Duchess Bona, a
princess of the house of Savoy, whom Duke Galeazzo
married in 1468 after the death of his first wife,
Dorotea Gonzaga, by whom he had no child. It is to
be supposed, probably, that the process of "legitimation,"
among its other mysterious virtues, had that of
inspiring a good church-woman with maternal feelings
for the offspring of another; for the Duchess Bona,
who seems to have been a kind and gentle rather than
a royal-souled lady, appears to have affectionately
welcomed the little stranger as a princess of the noble
house of Sforza, and to have done her best to prepare
her duly for the high fortunes to which her father
destined her, as a means of extending the connections
and assuring the greatness of his house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BALANCE OF POWER.</div>

<p>Such schemes, and others directed to the same end,
formed the principal serious occupation of the Italian
princes of that time, and were the fruitful source of
atrocities and abominations innumerable, as the reader
of Italian history well knows. To a certain degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
such ambition found its excuse in the great law of self-preservation.
For in the perpetually shifting scene
produced by the alliances, jealousies, leagues, ruptures,
friendships and treasons, of a crowd of petty potentates,
it was well nigh impossible for any family of princely
rank to hold its own, neither encroaching itself, nor
encroached on by others. The fortunes of each were
ever on the rise, or on the decline. And at the period of
our heroine's appearance on the scene, the peace, which
Italy was then enjoying, was preserved only by a careful
maintenance of the balance of power between some four
or five of the leading princes of the peninsula.</p>

<p>How large a portion of the labours and of the abilities
of statesmen has been devoted to the perpetual
trimming of this troublesome balance, at a later period
of the world's history on the great theatre of Europe, we
all know. And it is interesting to observe how thoroughly
the theory was understood, and how perfectly
and sedulously reduced to practice by exceedingly
accomplished professors of the art of state-craft, in the
miniature world shut off from the rest of Europe by the
Alps. Indeed, the smallness of the objects to be
weighed against each other rendered the task of keeping
the scales even in that microcosm a peculiarly delicate
one. Where very small matters were capable of disarranging
the adjustment of the balance, only great
dexterity and prudence could preserve the equilibrium.
And accordingly, the game of checking and counter-checking,
far-sighted schemes of attack, and still more
cunningly devised means for future defence, was carried
on upon that small chess-board with a perfection of
duplicity, vigilance, and small vulpine sagacity, which
might give a lesson to most modern professors of the
same art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Ferdinand of Aragon at Naples, Popes Paul II.,
and his successor Sixtus IV. at Rome, Lorenzo
the Magnificent at Florence, Galeazzo Maria Sforza
at Milan, and the Republic of Venice,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> were the
powers between whom and by whom the balance of
power, the peace of Italy, and the possessions of each
of them, were to be preserved. The first four of these
were, at the time in question, united in a common
course of policy by the necessity of watching and keeping
in check the ambitious Queen of the Adriatic, far
more powerful than any one of the four, though much
less so than all of them together. The rest of Italy,
not comprised in the above five states, consisted of a
crowd of petty principalities, which served singularly to
complicate the game played by the great players, and
to increase the interest of its vicissitudes. If endowed
with any military talent, these small princes of a city
and its immediate neighbourhood would take service as
generals of the forces, in the pay of one or other of
their more powerful neighbours. And in this way
several of them became important elements in the calculations
of those potentates. Some, again, would die
without heirs male, and leave their female successors,
daughter or widow, a prize to be scrambled for by the
royal crowd always on the look out for such windfalls.
Others were perpetually at feud with their own subjects,
and thus gave an opportunity to some neighbour to
intervene on behalf of one or the other party, with the
same ultimate result. Finally, (and this was perhaps
the way in which they most seriously compromised the
tranquillity and influenced the destinies of Italy)&mdash;they
formed the material from which each new Pope, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
was anxious to be the founder of a princely family
sought to carve out a dominion for his "nephews" by
any of those arts of fraud or intimidation, of which
Rome was so consummate a mistress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROJECTS OF MARRIAGE.</div>

<p>No sooner had Catherine's legitimation given her
the value of a piece on the political chess-board, than
she became involved in the moves of the game. At a
very early age she had been promised in marriage to
the Count Onorato Torelli, scion of a noble family,
which had in the preceding generation given valuable
support to the Sforzas, ere their star was so decidedly
in the ascendant. But Catherine became a princess;
the young Onorato very conveniently died; and Duke
Galeazzo conceived schemes for selling his daughter in
a better market. The Manfredi were lords of Imola,
a neat little city, situated in the midst of a rich alluvial
territory between the foot of the Apennines and the
Adriatic, about twenty miles to the south of Bologna;
a compact and very desirable little sovereignty in
short, with taxes capable of an increased yield in the
hands of an enterprising possessor.</p>

<p>Now it so happened, that Tadeo Manfredi, the reigning
prince, was involved in a dangerous quarrel with
Guidazzo, his son, who complained that his spendthrift
father was loading "the property" with an unconscionable
amount of debt. And this uncomfortable state of
things was talked over at the splendid court of Milan.
Whereupon Duke Galeazzo came forward with a proposition,
which he hoped would prove acceptable to all
parties. He would assign within the limits of his
duchy an appanage to Tadeo, would pay that extravagant
old gentleman's debts, and would give his
daughter Catherine, with the lordship of Imola, which
was thenceforth to be his, to Guidazzo. The bargain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
certainly appeared advantageous enough to the Manfredi.
The debts would be paid, and Guidazzo the heir,
would after all be lord of his father's state; and whether
in his own right, or that of his wife, would not so
much signify.</p>

<p>But that little lady was, at the time she was thus
disposed of, scarcely more than eight or nine years old.
Poor Guidazzo had therefore to content himself with
the promise of her hand, when she should have
reached a marriageable age. And never was there
period in the world's history, or clime on its surface,
where slips between cup and lip were more abundant
than in those good old times on the sunny side of the
Alps.</p>

<p>Meanwhile old Tadeo is shelved on the estate of
Castelnuovo, near Alessandria; Imola and its territory
has passed into the hands of Duke Galeazzo;
and young Guidazzo is dangling about the gay and
magnificent court of Milan, and deems his fortune is
a ripening, while his promised bride is daily growing
in grace, beauty, and princely accomplishments, under
the hot-house influences of the same splendid and
dazzling environment.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Dazzling indeed was the pomp, and ostentatiously
reckless the expenditure of wealth, amid which
Catherine passed those years of her life, when the
impressions eagerly received from external objects are
the most busy in forming the taste, and modifying the
character. For the age was one of rapidly increasing
luxury and riches. And the parvenu sovereign of
Milan was especially bent on eclipsing his peers, and
proving his right to his position among them by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
unrivalled display of all that tailors, upholsterers,
mercers, and jewellers can do towards creating the
majesty that should hedge a king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DUCAL JOURNEY</div>

<p>It was very shortly after he had concluded the
arrangements for Catherine's future marriage, that,
fired with this right royal ambition, Galeazzo determined
on a festal journey to Florence, Lucca, Pisa,
and so home by Genoa. Lorenzo, "the Magnificent,"
was sovereign in all save name at Florence, and now
he was to be shown that Milan's Duke could advance
a better claim to so proud a title. The Duchess Bona
accompanied him. And from the provision of no less
than twelve litters, it may be concluded that the other
female members of his family, and doubtless Catherine
among them, were of the party. These litters are
called by a contemporary writer,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> carts&mdash;"caretti"&mdash;but
he adds that they were <i>carried on</i> mules over the
mountains. The carts were covered with awnings of
cloth of gold, embroidered with the ducal arms; and
the "mattresses and feather beds" which were laid in
the bottoms of them, were some of cloth of gold, some
of silver, and some of crimson satin.</p>

<p>All the great feudatories who held of the Duke, and
all the members of his council, each followed by several
splendidly dressed servants, attended him. All the
members of the ducal household were clothed in velvet.
Forty footmen were decorated with golden collars, and
other forty with embroidery. The Duke's grooms were
dressed in silk, ornamented with silver. There were
fifty led horses, with housings of cloth of gold, and gilt
stirrups; an hundred men-at-arms, "each dressed as if
he were a captain;" five hundred foot soldiers, all
picked men; an hundred mules, covered with cloth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
gold; and fifty magnificently caparisoned pages. Two
thousand other horses, and two hundred more mules,
all covered with rich damask, carried the baggage of
the multitudinous host. Five hundred couples of
hounds, with huntsmen and falcons and falconers in
proportion, together with trumpeters, players, mimes,
and musicians, made part of the monstrous cortège.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Let the reader picture to himself this gilded and
velvet covered army, slowly wending in long slender
file, glistening dazzlingly in the southern sun, but
grievously tormented under their ponderously magnificent
trappings by the same, as they laboured
over the steep and sinuous Apennine paths, by which
alone they could reach mountain-girt Florence. For
only a difficult bridle-path then crossed those mountains,
over which the traveller now rolls in his carriage
between Modena and Florence. Let him imagine, too,
the camp of the brilliant, but wayworn host, pitched
for the night amid the shelter of a chestnut? forest, in
the midst of those wild hills, where even now, and
much less then, there is neither town nor village
capable of housing a tithe of such a multitude. And
further, while amusing his fancy with such gorgeous
and picturesque imaginings, let him not forget, that
every yard of this cloth-of-gold, and richly-tinted
velvet, represented the value of some horny palm's
hard labour, the sweat of some weary brow, wrung
from the wronged labourer by the most cruel and
lawless severities of extortion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">READING ROMAN HISTORY.</div>

<p>But while the Duke and his Court were startling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
world with the glories of this unprecedented cavalcade,
making awe-struck peasants wonder, emulous peers
envy, and angels weep, there were three young nobles,
who had remained at home at Milan, engaged in
reading "certain passages of Roman history" with
their schoolmaster, one Cola Montano. Their names
were Giovanni Andrea Lampugnano, Girolamo Olgiato,
and Carlo Visconti; and, I dare say, descendants of
theirs, whether under those names or others, may yet
be found in the fair city of Milan; and perhaps they
may be equally fond of reading the Roman history,&mdash;an
occupation, it might be supposed, as innocent,
though not so fatiguing, as riding over the Apennines in
a suit of cloth of gold. Yet the reverend and right-minded
historian,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> who mentions the circumstance,
speaks of their occupation with much disgust and
indignation. Perhaps he is right. Perhaps "certain
passages of Roman history" are not wholesome reading
for the subjects of splendid princes.</p>

<p>For the present, however, we will let Galeazzo ride
on in his glory, and the young gentlemen pursue their
story-fed meditations in tranquillity at Milan.</p>

<p>The Duke arrived at Florence on the 13th of March,
and was magnificently received by the magnificent
Lorenzo, who entertained him and his family in his
own house, while the enormous body of his retainers
and followers were lodged and fed at the cost of the
city. The Florentine historian, Ammirato,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> after having
enumerated all the particulars of the pomp detailed
above, goes on in the true spirit of the old Italian city-patriotism
to maintain, that Galeazzo, "for all that,
young and proud, and the minion of Fortune, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
was, found himself obliged to admit that all his splendour
was outdone by the magnificence of Lorenzo," inasmuch
as the precious treasures of the Medici were
far more admirable from the artistic excellence of the
workmanship, than from the mere value of the material.
"He could not but confess," continues the partisan of
the Italian Athens, "that art had a higher value than
mere costliness, as being attainable only by more
arduous labour, and with greater difficulty; while he
declared, that in all Italy he had not seen so great a
number of paintings by the first masters, of gems,
beautiful vases, statues ancient and modern, bronzes,
medals, and rare books, as he now saw collected in the
palace of the Medici;&mdash;treasures which he should
esteem cheaply purchased by any quantity of silver or
gold."</p>

<p>Florence did all she could for the amusement of her
princely guests. But as it was in time of Lent, she
could not, as she did twelve years previously, when
Galeazzo had visited the city as a boy, show him a
"hunt," as the historian calls it,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> of wolves, boars,
lions, and a giraffe, on the Piazza of Santa Croce!
To be "like the time," it was necessary that the dissipations
should be of an ecclesiastical character. So
the gallant company were treated to a representation of
the Annunciation in the church of St. Felice, to the
Ascension in the church of the Carmine, and to the
descent of the Holy Ghost on the Apostles, at the
church of the Santo Spirito.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The souls of the Lombards,
says Ammirato, were filled with admiration of
the wonderful artifices and ingenuity displayed on this
occasion. And all passed off with the greatest éclat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
save that the church of Santo Spirito was burned to
the ground by the forked tongues of fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EFFECTS OF A DUCAL VISIT.</div>

<p>This little accident was the only circumstance, that
tended, says the historian, to mingle some flavour of
bitterness with the general rejoicing. But the graver
citizens of the republic complained that the brilliant
Duke, when he started two days after this disaster on
his return to his own states, full of compliments and
admiration at his hospitable reception, left behind him
among the young Florentine nobles a taste for profusion
and display, which was a far greater evil than
the enormous expense to which the city had been put,
including the cost of rebuilding their burned church.</p>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">A Franciscan Pope and a Franciscan Cardinal.&mdash;A notable illustration
of the proverb concerning mendicant's rides.&mdash;The Nemesis of
Despotism.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The first news that reached the Court of Milan,
after the return of the Duke, full of gratified vanity
and glorification from his progress, was that of the
death of Pope Paul II.,&mdash;that superb old man, who,
if he had none other of the qualities befitting the
head of the Church, yet at least looked every inch a
Pope; of whom one of the chroniclers of the time
says, that not having succeeded very well in his attempts
at literary culture, "he determined to make his pontificate
reputable by ornamental pomp, in which his
majestic presence, and pre-eminently tall and noble
person helped him not a little, giving him, as it did,
the appearance of a new Aaron, venerable and reverend
beyond that of any other Pontiff."</p>

<p>And the tidings of the death of this magnificent lay-figure
Pope were very shortly followed by the yet more
interesting news of the election of his successor, on
the 9th of August, 1471.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FRIAR POPE.</div>

<p>This successor was Francesco della Rovere, who had
risen from the cell of a Franciscan friar by his merit
as a scholar and theologian, and by his eloquence as a
preacher, to be first, General of his order, then Cardinal;
and now reached, as Sixtus IV., the highest
aim of an ecclesiastic's ambition. He was the son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of a poor fisherman of the coast near Savona. For
the fiction of the heralds, who found for him a place
in the genealogy of the noble family of the same name,
was an afterthought of the time, when such a relationship
was acceptable to all the parties concerned. For
though the Borghesi decidedly objected, as we have
seen, to own any connection with a <i>roturiere</i> saint, the
Della Rovere were well pleased enough to find a kinsman
in a Pope, whose greatness manifested an immediate
tendency to take a quite terrestrial and tangible
shape.</p>

<p>For this barefooted mendicant friar&mdash;the vowed
disciple of that St. Francis whom no degree of poverty
would satisfy short of meeting his death naked and
destitute on the bare earth&mdash;this monk, sworn to practise
an humility abject in the excess of its utter self-abnegation,
was the first of a series of popes who one
after the other sacrificed every interest of the Church,
waded mitre deep in crime and bloodshed, and plunged
Italy into war and misery, for the sake of founding a
princely family of their name.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe, that generally throughout
the pontifical history, scandalously infamous popes
and tolerably decent popes, are found in bunches, or
series of six or eight in succession; a striking proof
of the fact that when they have been of the better
sort, the amelioration has been due to some force of
circumstance operative from without. Never were
they worse, with perhaps one or two exceptions, than
during the century which preceded the first quickly-crushed
efforts of the Reformation in Italy&mdash;from
about 1450, that is to say, down to 1550. Competing
Protestantism then began to act on the Roman Church
exactly as competing Methodism acted on the Anglican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Church three centuries later; and a series of Popes of
a different sort was the result.</p>

<p>But the conduct of the great family-founding popes,
which strikes us, looking at it through the moral
atmosphere of the nineteenth century, as so monstrous,
wore a very different aspect even to the gravest censors
among their contemporaries. The Italian historians
of the time tell us of the "royal-mindedness" and
"noble spirit" of this ambitious Franciscan, Pope
Sixtus, in a tone of evident admiration. And the
gross worldliness, the low ambition, and the unscrupulous
baseness, of which he may fairly be accused,
did not seem even to Du Plessis Mornai,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and the
French Protestant writers of that stamp, to be sufficient
ground for denouncing him and the system which produced
him. Otherwise they would not have disgraced
themselves and their cause by asserting that he was
guilty of hideous and nameless atrocities, for which, as
the less zealous but more candid Bayle<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> has sufficiently
shown, there is no foundation either in fact or
probability.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A POPE'S NEPHEW.</div>

<p>The new Pope lost no time in turning the papacy to
the best possible account, in the manner which had for
him the greatest attractions. And it so happened that
he was singularly well supplied with the raw material
from which the edifice of family greatness he was bent
on raising was to be furnished forth. He had no less
than nine nephews: five of them the sons of his three
brothers, and four the sons of his three sisters!&mdash;a
field for nepotism sufficiently extensive to satisfy the
"high-spirited" ambition of even a Sixtus IV. But
among all this wealth of nephews, the two sons of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
eldest sister, Girolamo and Pietro Riario, were distinguished
by him so pre-eminently, that a great many
contemporary writers, thinking it strange that he should
prefer them to those of his own name, have asserted
that these young men were in fact his sons.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Giuliano
della Rovere, the eldest of all the nine, who received a
cardinal's hat from his uncle, but could obtain from
him no further favour, was nevertheless destined, as
Pope Julius II., to become by far the most important
pillar of the family greatness. The course of Catherine's
fortunes, however, will justify the present reader
in confining his attention, as all Rome was doing in
the year 1472, to the two fortunate young men on
whom the pontifical sun shone brightest.</p>

<p>Peter Riario was, like his uncle, a Franciscan monk,
and was twenty-six years old when the latter was
elected. Within a very few months he became Bishop
of Treviso, Cardinal-Archbishop of Seville, Patriarch
of Constantinople, Archbishop of Valentia, and Archbishop
of Florence! From his humble cell, from his
ascetic board, from his girdle of rope and woollen
frock renewed yearly, and baked occasionally to destroy
the vermin bred in its holy filth, this poverty-vowed
mendicant suddenly became possessed of revenues so
enormous, that his income is said to have been larger
than that of all the other members of the Sacred College
put together! The stories which have been preserved<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
of his reckless and unprecedented expenditure at
Rome, would seem almost incredible were they not
corroborated by the fact that he had in a very short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
time, besides dissipating the enormous wealth assigned
to him, incurred debts to the amount of sixty thousand
florins! He gave a banquet to the French ambassadors
which cost twenty thousand crowns, a sum equal
to more than ten times the same nominal amount at
the present day. "Never," says the Cardinal of Pavia,
"had pagan antiquity seen anything like it. The
whole country was drained of all that was rare and
precious; and the object of all was to make a display,
such as posterity might never be able to surpass.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
The extent of the preparations, their variety, the
number of the dishes, the price of the viands served
up, were all registered by inspectors, and were <i>put into
verse</i>, of which copies were profusely circulated, not
only in Rome, but throughout Italy, and even beyond
the Alps."</p>

<p>Girolamo, the brother of this spendthrift monk, and
equally a favourite of his uncle, was a layman; and the
process of enriching and aggrandising him was necessarily
a somewhat slower one. Not even a fifteenth-century
pope could accomplish so monstrous an iniquity
and insult to humanity as the promotion of Peter Riario
in any other branch or department of human affairs save
the Church! Girolamo, however, who was, we are
told, "not literate," was at once made Captain-General
of the pontifical troops, and Governor of the Castle of
St. Angelo. And for his further advancement measures
were adopted, which, among other advantages, have
conferred upon him that of occupying a prominent
place in these pages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SLIP BETWEEN CUP AND LIP.</div>

<p>For it so happened, that the elevation of Sixtus IV.
to the papal throne turned out to be the "slip" which
dashed from poor Guidazzo's lips the cup he was waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
for in the shape of the bride, who was to bring
back to him as her dower his lost principality of Imola.
The tidings from Rome, which were astonishing all
history with accounts of the wonderful and unprecedented
"greatness" achieved by the Riario brothers,
produced a prodigious sensation at the court of Milan.
Here was evidently a rising sun worth a little worship!
And now, how valuable became our little "legitimatised"
Kate, as a means of hooking on our ducal fortunes to
the career of this "high-spirited" Pope, and the magnificent
nephews so evidently marked out for high destinies!
What was Guidazzo and his little state of
Imola in comparison to the favourite nephew of a
"high-spirited" Pope? And besides, there is no
reason to give up Imola, because we give up Guidazzo.
Imola is in our own hands, and will make a dower for
our daughter by no means unworthy of the consideration
of a Franciscan monk's reputed son, about to start
on his career of sovereign prince. So Guidazzo may
go whistle for his patrimony!</p>

<p>The gorgeous accounts of the Cardinal Peter Riario's
unprecedented splendour and reckless prodigality especially
touched a sympathetic chord of admiration in the
bosom of Maria Galeazzo. The splendid Duke, who
lavished on upholstery, festivals, and courtezans, the
substance wrung from a groaning people, recognised a
kindred spirit in the princely churchman, who expended
the revenues of a dozen sees on a banquet and revel.
The spirit of noble rivalry, too, was awakened in the
Ducal bosom. Here was a man in whose eyes it was
worth while to shine, and whose admiration would confer
real glory.</p>

<p>It was to the Cardinal, accordingly, that Galeazzo
caused the first cautious overtures to be made; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the reception of them was such as to encourage him to
entreat his Eminence to honour his poor court with a
visit. The Cardinal was nothing loth to accept the
invitation. He, too, recognised in the Duke of Milan
that "greatness" which was most calculated to excite
his sympathy and admiration. He, too, felt, that here
was a spirit of his own calibre,&mdash;one with whom he
would willingly pull together in the arduous work of
furthering their mutual fortunes, and vie in the ostentation
of magnificence.</p>

<p>The Cardinal's visit to Milan was accordingly
arranged with as little delay as possible. He left Rome
with a train more like that of the most magnificent of
popes, say the chroniclers, than what might befit a
cardinal, and reached Milan on the 12th of September,
1473.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Great were the preparations made to receive
him, and bitter were the groans of the magnificent
Duke's hapless subjects under the new extortions
necessitated by their master's gorgeous "hospitality."
The glittering cavalcade of the lay prince met the no
less glittering cavalcade of the ecclesiastical prince at
the gates of the city; and, as those were "ages of
faith," both proceeded at once to the cathedral to inaugurate
the pleasure and business of the meeting by a
solemn "Te Deum." So thoroughly did the sanctifying
influences of religion, as has been often remarked,
pervade every affair of life in those happy times!</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUCAL AMUSEMENTS.</div>

<p>All Milan was witness to the festal doings on this
notable meeting,&mdash;the processioning, revelling, tailoring,
gilding, and reckless profusion, which marked the noble
rivalry between these two great men. This friendly
emulation was pushed to an intensity, which seems
unhappily to have led the lay champion in the generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
contest to have recourse to disloyal arms against his
rival. For a tell-tale gossip of the pestilent race of
scribblers has recorded that the great Galeazzo purchased
secretly a quantity of imitation gems, and passed
them off for real;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> an anecdote extremely creditable to
the fifteenth century artificers in that line. In all the
ordinary pastimes and pleasures of the princes of that
day, of whatever sort, the splendid Cardinal, though
so recently a mendicant friar, was able and willing to
run neck and neck with his secular host. But some of
Maria Galeazzo's favourite enjoyments were not ordinary.
He was ever an avid eye-witness of the executions,
tortures, and mutilations, which his duty as a
sovereign obliged him frequently to inflict on his subjects.
We have indeed on record a sufficient number
of instances of princes who had this taste, to justify
our deeming it part of a despotic ruler's natural idiosyncrasy.
But Galeazzo had stranger, if less maleficent,
propensities. He revelled in the sight of death, and
human decay. Some strange touch of that insanity,
which so frequently, and with such salutary warning,
develops itself in minds exposed to the poison that
wells out from the possession of unchecked power,
influenced, as in such cases it is apt to do, his moral
rather than his intellectual nature. He would cause
himself to be brought into the presence of the suffering,
the dying, and the dead, for the mere pleasure of witnessing
pain and destruction. He would rifle graves
to gaze on the process of corruption, and haunted
charnel-houses, impelled by the instinct of the ghoul,
rather than by any touch of that sentiment, which impels
the morbid fanatic to seek in such contemplatio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
a moving sermon on the vanity of human wishes.
This man, whose wishes, hopes, and ambitions were
as unbridled in their violence as low and vain in their
aims and scope, would hurry from the death-chamber
to the revel, and from the charnel-house hasten to plot
long-sighted intrigues in the council-hall.</p>

<p>For the latter the pleasure-loving Cardinal was as
ready as for gala making and revelry. Long conferences
were held between the host and his guest in
the secrecy of the Duke's private chambers. But
princes are more than other men subjected to the vigilant
surveillance of those who form their pomp or
minister to their service. And their secrets, therefore,
are rarely absolutely secret. Accordingly, Corio, the
page, chamberlain, and annalist&mdash;a dangerous pluralism
for better sovereigns than Galeazzo Sforza!&mdash;Corio
informs us, though qualifying his assertion with a
cautious "si dice," that these prolonged discussions
had for their object the terms of a bargain between the
Duke and the Cardinal, by virtue of which the former
was to be exalted into King of Lombardy by the
acquisition of sundry provinces from the smaller
princes around him, and especially by the conquest of
the terra-firma possessions of Venice; while the latter
was to be insured the succession to his uncle on the
papal throne. This statement of the chamberlain and
page has been believed by most subsequent historians.
Verri, without any qualification, writes that such was
the fact. Rosmini contents himself with saying that
such is believed to have been the case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DONE AND DONE.</div>

<p>But alas! for the short span which should forbid
such long-sighted hopes. To men who live such lives as
his Eminence the Cardinal Riario, the span is apt to be
especially short. And as for the Duke ... there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Cola Montano the scholar, and his three young pupils,
all the time of this splendid revelry in Milan, reading
Roman history harder than ever!</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other business, which had to be settled
between the high contracting powers&mdash;the marriage
of Catherine to Girolamo Riario&mdash;though not unattended
with those difficulties which naturally arise
between parties intent on driving a hard bargain, was
at length brought to a satisfactory conclusion. The
Duke was to give his daughter the city and territory
of Imola, and sixteen thousand ducats, besides certain
estates in the Milanese for her separate use. The Pope
was to give Girolamo forty thousand ducats, and
"expectations;" which, in the case of such a nephew
of such a Pope, might fairly be reckoned at a high
figure.</p>

<p>The youthful bride, just past her eleventh birthday,
was accordingly betrothed publicly to Girolamo Riario,
who performed his part of the ceremony by proxy.
The young couple had never seen each other; but we
are told much of the mutual admiration of the future
brother and sister-in-law for each other. The Cardinal
was loud in his praises of the beauty, grace, and
accomplishments of the hot-house forced child, who was
to be made so important a stepping-stone to his
brother's fortunes. And she was dazzled and delighted
with his magnificence and splendour, and especially
charmed, we are assured,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> by his eloquence!</p>

<p>The luxuriously-nurtured little lady, it may be fancied,
would not have appreciated so highly the "eloquence"
of the mendicant friar, had he presented
himself to her notice in his garb of some three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
previously. But when grave historians<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> assure us,
that the fortunate monk on his elevation "put on a
lofty and imperial spirit," and when all Italy was
admiringly marvelling at his cost-despising splendour,
a little girl, and she the daughter of Galeazzo Sforza, may
be excused for being captivated by one, who appeared
to possess in a higher degree than any other man, all
that her experience of life had taught her to value.</p>

<p>When these matters had thus been satisfactorily
settled, the Cardinal prepared to bring his visit to a
conclusion, and informed his host of his intention to
pass a short time at Venice before returning to Rome.
The Duke strongly urged him to abandon any such
idea. The secret schemes which they had been engaged
in concocting, were mainly based on the intended
spoliation of the great republic. Uneasy suspicions,
as the chroniclers mention, had already been aroused
in various courts by the prolonged conferences of the
Duke and his guest. The Signory of Venice had proverbially
long ears, and unscrupulous arms at its command.
It might well be, urged the Duke, that at the
present conjuncture, Venice might not be so safe a
place of sojourn for his Eminence as could be wished.
Probably, also, Sforza had jealous suspicions that
Riario's business at Venice might possibly be to play
a double game,&mdash;to throw him over in case contingencies
might arise to make such a policy expedient,&mdash;and
to prepare his way with the Signory for any
such eventualities.</p>

<p>At all events his representations and endeavours
were in vain. The Cardinal was bent on visiting
Venice; and to Venice he went. In all probability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
his leading motive was to exhibit his magnificence to
the nobles of perhaps the richest and most pleasure-loving
capital in Italy. Nowhere did that taste for
show and festive pomp, which was so especially his
own, prevail to so insane a degree as among the money-making
nobles of the Queen of the Adriatic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMPAGNIA DELLA CALZA.</div>

<p>The celebrated "Compagnia della Calza," or Guild
of the Stocking, was flourishing there, and distinguishing
itself by extravagances altogether in the taste of
the brilliant Franciscan Cardinal. This stocking
brotherhood, which derived its name from the circumstance
of each member wearing parti-coloured hose,
differently quartered with brilliant colours, was instituted
by the wealthy young nobles,&mdash;the <i>jeunesse dorée</i>
of pleasure-loving Venice&mdash;for the avowed purpose of
encouraging magnificence in dress, and of providing
opportunities for the exhibition of it by organising
those gala spectacles and pomps, which so many of
the gorgeous artists of the republic have perpetuated
on their glowing canvas. The description<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> given us
of their costume is made up of velvet, satin, embroidery,
cloth of gold, brocade and jewels. On the long
pointed hood which hung at their backs, was embroidered
the heraldic cognisance of each man's family;
which was repeated on that part of the black or red
cap, which hung pendant over the ear. The hair, which
was kept as long and as abundant as possible, was tied
up with a cord of silk. The doublets generally of
velvet, were worn with slashed sleeves showing a portion
of fine linen underneath, and tied with silken cords
ornamented with tassels of solid gold. In the hand it
was the mode to carry a ball containing perfumes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<p>The Cardinal, Archbishop of so many churches,
was ambitious of exhibiting his magnificence among
these illustrious youths, and taking a part in their
gorgeous revels. Despite the prognostications of
the Duke of Milan, he was received with all honour
by the Venetians, hailed as a worthy compeer by
the heroes of the parti-coloured stocking, fêted to
his heart's content, and taken leave of, when towards
the end of the year he started on his return to
Rome, with every demonstration of respect and
friendship.</p>

<p>But there were ancient Senators in Venice, very
gravely sitting in one of those thick-walled smaller
chambers on the second floor of the Ducal palace,
reading despatches in cypher from secret agents,
taking secret counsel together, and making secret provision
for the safety of the republic, while the <i>jeunesse
dorée</i> and the gay and gallant guest, who had so
recently been plotting against the Queen of the
Adriatic, were dazzling the citizens with their gilding
and parti-coloured hose.... And it
did so happen, that the young Cardinal died from
some cause or other, a few days after his arrival in
Rome.</p>

<p>Mnemosyne says nothing; since she knows nothing
on the subject, beyond the facts here set down. But
she may be permitted to observe, on the one hand, that
fifteenth-century dissipation was particularly destructive
of human life, and that the Cardinal had evidently for
some time past been leading a life to kill any man;&mdash;and
on the other hand, that as a specimen of the good
old times, the very general contemporary suspicion that
St. Mark's lion <i>had</i> stretched out on this occasion a
long and stealthy paw, comes much to the same thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
as evidence of character, as if the deed itself were
chronicled.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CARDINAL PETER'S EPITAPH.</div>

<p class="b1">The Cardinal died on the 5th of January, 1474, to
the great grief of Pope Sixtus, says Corio,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and to the
infinite delight of the whole college of Cardinals. The
indignation caused by the accumulation of so many
scandalous vices, and so many rich benefices on one
pair of purple shoulders, manifested itself after the
wonted fashion of the eternal city in a volley of epigrams
and satirical epitaphs more savage than witty.
One somewhat to the following effect,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> was found
placarded on the monument raised over his remains
by the afflicted Pope:</p>

<p class="ppi15">"Once more let worth, and long lost virtue reign,<br />
And vice be banish'd from its throne in Rome!</p>
<p class="ppb15">Rogues, wretches, profligates, and all their train<br />
No more shall find on Latian soil their home;</p>
<p class="pp13">For he, the plague-spot of our church and state,<br />
Peter, is gone to meet in hell his fate."</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Orthodox Burriel, however, assures us, that all the
malicious outpourings of envious hate were silenced
and put to shame by the following victorious couplet
in the genuine decorous tombstone style.</p>

<p class="pp13">
"Sage in his prime!&mdash;'tis that has caused our tears;<br />
Death from his virtues deemed him full of years."</p>

<p class="p1">Among the select minority, who truly mourned the
premature death of this youthful sage, the Duke of
Milan and his daughter may be safely reckoned. The
marriage arranged wholly by him might very possibly
run risk of being broken off. And in any case the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Duke's ulterior and more ambitious schemes were
nipped in the bud.</p>

<p>Catherine was, however, as her biographer assures
us, "infinitely rejoiced and comforted" by an early
courier from Rome, bearing assurances, that her unseen
bridegroom and his august kinsman had no intention
of allowing the Cardinal's death to make any difference
in the arrangements for the marriage.</p>

<p>Let the reader's mind dwell a moment on the "infinite
rejoicing and comfort" of this eleven-year-old
princess, at the news that she was not after all to lose
her marriage with an unseen stranger;&mdash;remembering
the while that, making allowance for longitude and
latitude, we Northerns may for "eleven" read thirteen
or fourteen.</p>

<p>The Duke prudently hastened to make peace with
his powerful and dangerous neighbours, the Venetians,
and having accomplished this, soothed his disappointment
by giving a magnificent reception to some envoys
sent to him by the Sultan of Egypt; a circumstance
so novel in Europe, as greatly to exalt, we are told,
the name and glory of the house of Sforza among
neighbouring, and even among transalpine, courts and
princes; and which naturally and necessarily required,
in order to do due honour to the occasion, new taxes
on the subjects of a dynasty so distinguished, new
pretexts for compelling rich citizens to purchase pardon
for imaginary offences, and new perversions of law for
the purpose of colouring confiscations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROMAN HISTORY READINGS COMPLETED.</div>

<p>These, however, were little matters, which passed in
the shade fitted for such things. The broad sunlight
of prosperity shone gloriously on the house of Sforza,
on its apparently durably established fortunes, and on
the gala doings in the gay streets of sunny Milan. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
poor might grumble low down in the social depths out
of hearing about scarcity and dearness of bread; a few
citizens might groan over ducats or lands abstracted,
or wives or daughters abducted for the needs or pleasures
of their gracious sovereign; but the admirable
principles of civil and religious duty and subordination,
which prevailed in those ages of faith, were such, that
in all probability the great Galeazzo might have continued
to preserve order, and save society in Milan, had
not those gloomy students, whom we have from time to
time caught sight of poring over their crabbed folios,
while the merry city was gazing at some brilliant and
costly pageant or other, brought their studies to a conclusion
towards the end of the year 1476. For though
it did so happen,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> that two out of Cola Montano's three
pupils owed to the Duke's profligacy a sister's shame,
while the family of the third had been unjustly deprived
by him of an inheritance, yet the historians, who have
recorded the facts, seem to be unanimously of opinion,
that had it not been for those pernicious historical
readings, they would have borne these misfortunes as
meekly as hundreds of their fellow-citizens did similar
mishaps, instead of posting themselves at the door of
the cathedral on St. Stephen's day in December of the
year 1476, and there stabbing to death their sovereign
lord in the midst of his guards, and of the assembled
crowd.</p>

<p>The names of these misled youths were Giovanni
Andrea Lampugnani, Girolamo Olgiato, and Carlo
Visconti. The first was killed by one of the Duke's
attendants immediately after the commission of his
crime. Visconti was arrested, and ordered to immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
execution by being quartered. Olgiato escaped from
the church, and fled to his father's house. But father
and brothers alike refused to afford him any shelter.
His mother alone found means to persuade a certain
priest to hide the murderer in his house. After three
days' concealment, the unhappy youth crept forth to
ascertain the aspect of the city, and the feelings of the
citizens thus liberated from their tyrant. The first
sight that met his eyes was the corpse of his friend and
fellow criminal Lampugnani, dragged through the
streets by an exulting and ferocious rabble. This
horrible proof of the futility of all his hopes, and of
the judgment passed upon his deed by his fellow-citizens,
so drove him to despair, that he at once gave
himself up into the hands of justice. On his trial for
the crime, seeing that none were left alive who could
be injured by the recital, he gave a full account of the
whole conspiracy. And from this document are drawn
the narratives of the historians. He was condemned to
be torn to pieces by iron pincers, "tanagliato;"&mdash;that
being the proper juridical term to indicate a by no
means unprecedented mode of punishment.</p>

<p>"Stabit vetus memoria facti" were the last words
uttered by the dying regicide, as the living flesh was
being rent from the quivering muscles. And indeed
the sad story has been made the subject of a tragedy
much praised by Milanese<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> writers; but which does
not seem, unfortunately, to have so moralised the tale,
as to make it likely that it should at present be represented
in the theatres of that city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUKE'S CHARACTER.</div>

<p>And, truly, when we find a man in the position, and
of the character of Verri, writing a grave and learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
history at the close of the last century, and representing
in its well-considered pages the deed of Girolamo
Olgiato as similar in kind to that of Oliver Cromwell,
we cannot but become sensible how wholly and irreconcileably
different the views and moral judgments of a
law-respecting Anglo-Saxon on such subjects, must
needs be from those of a people, to whom, for centuries,
<span class="smcap">LAW</span> has been presented only as the expression of
a despot's will. To the inmost heart of nations so
trained amiss, we may be sure, that "the wild justice
of revenge" will commend itself with a force of honest
conviction, proportioned ever to the amount of wrong
suffered, and not to the heinousness of wrong done, by
those who, at their own risk and peril, take upon
themselves the execution of it.</p>

<p>Thus died at the age of thirty-two years the magnificent
Maria Galeazzo Sforza, our heroine's father.
Did these pages profess to give a biography of him
instead of his daughter, it would be necessary to follow
the chroniclers of his time through the long and sickening
list of his cruelties and abominations. This we
may spare ourselves. For the purpose of showing
what tendencies and dispositions his daughter may be
supposed to have inherited, and what were the manners
and habits of the home in which, and from which, she
received her early impressions and education, it will be
sufficient, in addition to what has been already said, to
mention one or two of the facts which history has put
on record against this man.</p>

<p>There is every reason to believe that he murdered
his mother by poison. All the authorities
concur in representing her as an excellent and very
able princess, whose wisdom and energy ensured his
quiet succession to his father's throne. He very soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
became jealous of her authority; drove her by his ill
treatment from Milan; and is believed to have poisoned
her at the first halting-place of her journey from that
capital towards her own dower city, Cremona. His
guilt was very generally credited by his contemporaries,
and subsequent writers concur in thinking their
suspicions in all probability just.</p>

<p>Enough has probably been said in previous pages to
give the reader some idea of the profligate debauchery
which marked the whole course of his life. It is unnecessary
to transfer to an English page the details of
cynical immorality, mingled with a ferocious cruelty,
which seems to mark them to a certain degree with the
character of insanity, as recorded by the old writers,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
especially by Corio, his own personal attendant. It is
sufficient to have drawn attention to the influences
which must have been exercised by the moral atmosphere
of such a court, and such a home on the young
bride, who is about to step from it to a court of
her own.</p>

<p class="pbqi">Catherine's marriage.&mdash;"Petit Courrier des dames" for 1476.&mdash;Four
years of prosperity.&mdash;Life in Rome in the fifteenth century.&mdash;A
hunting party in the Campagna.&mdash;Guilty or not guilty?&mdash;Catherine
and her husband leave Rome.</p>


<p class="pn p2">If the death of the Cardinal Riario had seemed,
during a few anxious days, to throw a doubt on the
succesful termination of the matrimonial schemes projected
for Catherine, much greater was the danger to
which they were exposed by the untimely death of the
Duke. "Catherine herself," says Burriel, "considering
the circumstances of her birth, thought that it was now
all over with her fortune." And, in truth, it was hardly
to be hoped that the Duchess Bona, now Regent,
would consent to prejudice her own children by giving
up Imola as the dower of a stranger to her blood,
obtruded under such circumstances into her family.
Meanwhile, the bridegroom Girolamo, and his august,
"high-spirited" uncle, had, on their side, been struck
by similar misgivings on receiving the news of Maria
Galeazzo's death; and they were by no means disposed
to relinquish the principality, whose title Girolamo had
already assumed.</p>

<p>Sixtus, therefore, well aware, remarks Burriel, of
the truth of the proverb which teaches that "this
world is given to the active,"<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> lost no time in sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Cardinal Mellini to Milan, with orders to claim the
prompt execution of the marriage contract, and to
hurry on the performance of the ceremony by every
possible means. This active churchman arrived while
the Duchess and all Milan were still in the midst of the
confusion, anxieties, and uncertainties resulting from
the sudden demise of the Crown. The position of the
Duchess as Regent and guardian of her son, still in
his minority, was precarious and difficult. Subsequent
events at Milan abundantly show how difficult a task it
was to maintain her own and her son's rights against
the pretensions and encroachments of his uncles.
The friendship or hostility of the royal-minded and
high-handed <i>Servus servorum</i> might be of infinite
importance to her and to Milan. The good Bona, too,
was inclined to make it a point of honour to carry out
the intentions of her murdered husband. The Cardinal,
acting up zealously to his instructions, urged
unceasingly that "if 'twere done, 'twere well it were
done quickly." And thus it was brought about that,
without any alteration in the articles previously agreed
upon, Catherine was married to Girolamo Riario
acting by proxy, in the latter part of May, 1477.</p>

<p>As the mourning for the Duke was not yet over, the
ceremony was performed in a comparatively private
manner in the presence of the Cardinal and the
Duchess. And as no festivities and rejoicings were
under the circumstances permissible in Milan, it was
determined that the bride should depart immediately
for Rome, and that all such celebration should take
place there under the auspices of the young couple's
magnificent uncle. No record is found of the exact
date of the marriage; but Catherine arrived in Rome
about the end of May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE.</div>

<p>The "sensation" produced in Rome by the young
bride's arrival is dwelt on by the historians, and may
be readily believed. All the contemporary chroniclers
agree in describing her as eminently beautiful.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> A
modern historian<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> of Forlì cites in proof of the truth
of these assertions two likenesses of her still existing,
when he wrote, in the church of St. Jerome in that
city. And a Forlì coin and two medals, engraved for
the work of Burriel, fully confirm the praises of the
old writers. All three of these portraits appear to
have been made after the death of Girolamo Riario.
The face is hard and even stern, but full of vigour and
intelligence. The features are somewhat large, but of
beautiful outline and perfect regularity: a face to be
admired rather than to be loved.</p>

<p>When at fifteen she rode through the Porta del
Popolo into Rome, in the midst of the brilliant cavalcade
composed of all that was noblest in the eternal
city, those finely-cut features were doubtless softer in
their expression, more delicate in their beauty, and
more fitted to win all hearts in the manner we are
assured they did. It was about a generation later
that a jovial prelate,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> writing to his friend from Rome,
protested that nothing was wanting to the pleasures of
a residence there save "a court with ladies." But no
doubt the same want was a frequent one among the
tonsured epicureans of a court in which every high
office was held by a priestly incumbent. And now the
lamentable deficiency was about to be supplied by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
young and lovely bride of the most powerful, most
magnificent, and wealthiest prince in Rome. For all
this was Girolamo, the survivor of the two favoured
brothers, who had divided between them all that Papal
affection and munificence could bestow.</p>

<p>Doubtless nothing was left undone which could add
brilliancy to the gay cavalcade amid which Girolamo
brought his wife to her new home. The period was
especially favourable to the display of personal splendour;
and the fashion of dress, especially of female
costume, had recently assumed an elegance and costly
gorgeousness unknown to the previous generation. If
we would figure to ourselves our fifteen-year-old
heroine as she appeared on her richly-caparisoned
"dappled palfrey" to the admiring eyes of the Roman
citizens, we must picture her clad in one of those
then recently-introduced dresses called "Cyprians," of
which we hear so much in the records of the time, and
which were the favourite mode of the young and beautiful
towards the end of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Like other innovations in similar matters, this new
costume, we are told, gave much offence to the more
austere among those who never in their own day had
enjoyed any such opportunity of displaying their
charms, and who were now too old to profit by it.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
For, instead of being made to fit close round the
throat, the "Cyprian" was contrived to show the entire
neck. These dresses were cut square on the bust,
were extremely full around the feet, close-fitting from
the waist upwards, and had very long and large sleeves.
Some ladies would have even three of these celebrated
robes: one of blue, one of crimson, and one of watered
camblet&mdash;"zambellotto undato"&mdash;lined with silk or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
with mixed furs. Beautifully thin and fine veils of
white cotton were worn; and the hair was drawn back
over hair-cushions, and tied with strings of silk ornamented
with gold or with pearls. A girdle of silver
gilt or of pearls confined the dress at the waist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER ROMAN RESIDENCE.</div>

<p>We may be perfectly sure, that the daughter of
Sforza and bride of Riario displayed whatever was
most costly and most superb, as she passed from the
Porta del Popolo to the princely residence of her husband
on the Lungara, that long street which runs along
the farther bank of the river from St. Peter's to the
Porta Settimana. There the Riarii inhabited the spot
now marked on the maps as the Palazzo Corsini. Two
hundred and fifty years further down on the roll of
pontiffs the latter name is met with;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the place of the
magnificent Riarii knows them no more; and the
change of masters, which those delicious terraces,
looking down on the Farnese palaces and gardens,&mdash;the
creations of another Papal<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> family intermediate in
time between the Riarii and the Corsini&mdash;have undergone,
is a quite normal illustration of the working of
a system, which is the leading fact of Rome's modern
history.</p>

<p>In this magnificent home on the banks of the Tiber,
Catherine spent four happy, prosperous, and brilliant
years;&mdash;probably the most happy, the most prosperous,
and the most brilliant of her career. Never, perhaps,
since the old times of a Marozia and a Theodora, whose
boundless and shameless power in the eternal city had
given rise to the fable of a female Pope, had a woman
occupied a position of so much power and pre-eminence
in Rome. She very shortly became an all-powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
favourite with her uncle (or father-in-law) Sixtus.
All Rome was absolutely at her feet. Courtiers in
search of favour, litigants in search of justice&mdash;(or
injustice)&mdash;officials in search of promotion, brought
their petitions and applications to her. The most
important employments were often given according to
the recommendations of this girl in her teens, as
Burriel<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> assures us, without manifesting the shadow
of an idea, that there was anything objectionable in
such a mode of administering the Papal power. At
this period of her life, writes another<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> chronicler, she
was so great a favourite with the Pope, that most of
the princes of Italy, who had any request to make of
the Apostolic see, availed themselves of the intercession
of Catherine for the attainment of their
desires.</p>

<p>Though apparently totally unaware, that all this was
in any way otherwise than it should have been, the old
writers tell us much of Catherine's prudence, discretion
and moderation in wielding and managing the
great power so strangely entrusted to such hands. We
have no recorded facts adducible in direct proof of the
justice of this high praise. But we may find some
evidence in support of it from the observation of our
heroine under adversity; for which some later portions
of her career will afford abundant opportunity. Assuredly
there must have been materials of high and noble
quality in a nature not wholly corrupted and spoiled by
such an education and such environment in childhood
and in youth, as that which fell to the lot of this young
princess.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ORDELAFFI.</div>

<p>Dark days were not far distant; but all as yet in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
life had been rose-colour:&mdash;or purple-tinted rather;
for the more modest hue seems hardly gorgeous enough
to typify the blaze of prosperous sunshine which had
hitherto illumined her path. And now, during these
years at Rome, though they had been sufficiently
marked already as the minions of fortune, the star of
the young couple was still ever rising.</p>

<p>On the 15th of December of the year in which
Catherine arrived in Rome, her husband was with
much ceremony and speechifying made a citizen of the
eternal city.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>On the 4th of September 1480, the same fortunate
youth received from the Pope investiture of the city
and county of Forlì;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> of which the Duke of Urbino,
general of the forces of the Church, took possession in
his name. This city, now the capital of a delegation,
and one of the most important towns of Romagna, was
conveniently situated with regard to the principality of
Imola, already acquired by Girolamo in right of his
wife. Forlì is some sixteen miles to the south-east of
the latter town, in the same rich and highly productive
alluvial district, which lies between the Apennines and
the Adriatic. It had long been under the dominion of
its native lords, of the family of the Ordelaffi. The
story of their ousting, with its episodes of poisoning,
fighting, love-making, and plotting, though curious
enough, would lead us too far away from our more
immediate subject. Suffice it that the upshot was the
same, as it was in so many other similar cases. The
Pope declared that the old family had forfeited their
rights, that the fief had devolved to the Holy See; and,
accordingly, handed it over to his nephew-son.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 8th of September in the same year Count
Girolamo was solemnly made generalissimo of the
Papal forces. The diarist Jacopo of Volterra<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> tells us
how on that day, being the celebration of the nativity
of the blessed Virgin, the Pope and all the College of
Cardinals attended a solemn mass, in the course of
which the Count in full armour knelt at the feet of the
Pope, seated in front of the altar, and then and there
received the staff of command, and the standard; and
took the prescribed oaths, reading, says the historian,
the whole formula at length himself;&mdash;truly the most
arduous part of the matter in all probability to this
"non literatus" <i>preux</i> chevalier. All Rome, both
clerical and lay, was there, says gossiping Jacobus
Volaterranus, as much to see the Count go through
his part in the play, as to perform their devotions.</p>

<p>The picture of life in Rome at this period, obtainable
from the inartistic matter-of-fact narrations of these
diarists, the Jacopo just cited, Stefano Infessura, and
one or two others of the same class, is a strange and
striking one. Their ever-recurring accounts of solemnities,
celebrations, and festivals, are chequered with
notices almost equally frequent, and as calmly chronicled
of such deeds and occurrences, as we are accustomed
to hear reported from Sacramento, or San
Francisco, and to consider as the product of a new and
half-organised state of society. A noble patrician is
stabbed to death, while sitting at the door of his own
palace enjoying the evening air after supper. The
name of the murderer and his motive are briefly told,
and no further remark is made about the matter. A
raid is made by one family against another and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
men are killed; but none worth mentioning save one
or two nobles. Of such matters nobody dreams of
complaining. But when once on Ascension-day a great
mass of people had assembled as usual in expectation
of receiving the papal benediction, and Sixtus for some
unassigned reason did not come forth to give it, there
was great murmuring, and the multitude heaped bitter
curses, we are told, on the Pontiff, who had defrauded
them of his blessing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DEATH-BED SCENE.</div>

<p>The figures of the recently-married couple, however,
with whose fortunes our story is more immediately
concerned, appear most frequently, as might be expected,
during those years of their prosperity on the
bright squares of the chequered board. The Count,
indeed, is found figuring in one strange and unpleasant
scene a few days previous to his installation as commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>One of the Pope's nephews, Antonio Bassi, is lying
grievously ill on his death-bed. His cousin Girolamo
visits him the day before his death, and tries to comfort
him "with fraternal words," and assurances that
he will soon get well. But the dying man, either from
the peevishness of suffering, says the chronicler,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> or
because he knew that he could now speak out with
impunity what he had long felt, abused his powerful
cousin in the most violent manner, "mentioning
certain deeds of the Count universally condemned, and
certain conduct of his reprobated by all men; on
account of which, he said, the judgment of God, from
which no human power could avail to protect him,
would shortly fall on him. And in speaking of these
things, he used a degree of vehemence which none of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
those who knew him best had ever heard him speak
with when in health." The Count, it seems, took it
very quietly; but "we all standing round the bed
blushed for shame at the scene, and several of us
slunk away out of hearing." It would have been satisfactory
to have been told what these so universally
reprobated deeds and conduct were. Perhaps nephew
Bassi would have liked some of the good things that
were heaped on nephew Riario. There <i>was</i>, indeed, one
dark topic, of which we shall have to speak presently,
the indiscreet handling of which might well make
discreet courtiers slink out of hearing, lest their ears
should become the unwilling depositories of truths so
carefully concealed that history, after nearly four hundred
years of investigation, has failed in obtaining
satisfactory evidence of them. Could it have been that
the dying man felt himself so safe from earthly vengeance,
and so beyond all considerations of worldly
prudence, as to have dared to speak aloud in such a
tone of the black Pazzi tragedy? If so, we know how
dangerous it might have been to hear him. If so,
could Girolamo Riario have been so unmoved by his
upbraiding? Be it as it may, the above few hints, so
fortuitously, as it seems, floating on the surface of the
vast, black, all-devouring pool of oblivion, are all that
we have to speculate on in the matter. Antonio Bassi
died, and no "judgment" followed&mdash;yet awhile.</p>

<p>On the contrary, all sorts of festivities, mingling
themselves with the more serious business of prosperous
ambition, seem to have made up the life of the
young Count and Countess. One constantly recurring
cause of pomp and festival at Rome in those days, was
the arrival in the eternal city of strangers of note
from almost every part of Europe. English, German,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
French, Spanish, Italian, Greek ambassadors, cardinals,
or prelates, arrived in the great capital of Christianity
to ask favours of Heaven's vicegerent; to plead their
international or ecclesiastical causes and quarrels
before him; to bring him gifts and compliments from
distant potentates; to beg for assistance in money or
money's worth; to obtain absolution for national sins
committed against the Papal interest; or to secure aid
and connivance for such as could be shown to square
with it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GALA DOINGS AT ROME.</div>

<p>On the occasion of such arrivals, cardinals, with
their numerous retinues of attendants, lay and
clerical, used to go out to meet the strangers at the
gate, and bring them in pomp to the lodgings prepared
for them. Then followed grand ceremonial services in
the basilicas, in which modern Circenses the Roman
populace shared with delight, and vast banquets,
shared only by the privileged of the earth. Now and
then occur descriptions of gay doings of a less exclusive
character, in which all classes of that strangely-variegated
society are seen mingled in a more pleasing
and more picturesque fashion.</p>

<p>On Wednesday,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> the 22nd of March, 1480, for
instance, Ernest, Duke of Saxony, arrives at Rome for
the performance of a vow. He is accompanied by the
Duke of Brunswick and other German nobles. All
are clothed in black, with a staff embroidered in white
across the breast, as a symbol of pilgrimage. The
Pope and all the Sacred College go out to the Porta
del Popolo to meet him; and fortunately we have
among us two cardinals who can talk German. These
ride one on each side of his Serene Highness, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the cortège of some two hundred horses of the Duke's
retinue, together with all the trains of Pope and
cardinals, sweep on through the streets of Rome
towards St. Peter's. Sovereign princes coming to
Rome in discharge of vows of pilgrimage are worthy
of every encouragement. So Sixtus treats the noble
stranger with all possible honour&mdash;even to the extent
of allowing him to sit at mass and vespers on the
bench of the cardinals, and in the stall next below the
junior of those dignitaries, an honour rarely granted.
Then, as is the case with those whom Rome delighteth
to honour, he was presented in St. Peter's with the
consecrated golden rose. But on this occasion, strangely
enough, the golden rose was not a rose, but a golden
oak-bough,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> which Sixtus, contrary to all custom and
precedent, had chosen to consecrate instead of the
immemorially accustomed emblem. The substitution
of this golden bough, the well-known heraldic bearing
of the Della Rovere family, is a curious manifestation
of the family feeling, which was so intense in Sixtus,
and was the ever-present motive of all his crimes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HUNTING PARTY.</div>

<p>But the most pleasing of the doings in honour of
the Elector recorded by the old diarist, is a grand
hunting party given him by our Count Girolamo.
It took place on the 10th of April, 1480, a day remembered
by the people of Rome long afterwards, says
Jacopo of Volterra. For the hunting took place only
eight miles from the city, in the neighbourhood of the
Fonte Malliane, to the south-west of Rome, and all
classes of the citizens made holiday. Even the boys
were able to join and enjoy the sport. The foreign
princes themselves, with their retinue, all mounted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
splendid horses, holding the hounds in leash, and
shining, says the diarist, with gold and jewels, were
the most interesting part of the sight to the populace.
A very great quantity of stags and deer were taken,
"and some beasts were captured by the hands of the
princes themselves, <i>as if the creatures suffered themselves
to be caught from the wish to contribute to the happiness
of so great an occasion</i>"&mdash;a somewhat left-handed
compliment to a sportsman, friend Jacopo, and savouring
more of the antechamber than the greenwood. A
more joyous scene, adds the diarist, cannot be imagined
than that afforded by those hill-sides and woods
thronged with eager sportsmen, and resounding far and
near with the notes of the horns, the halloes of the
hunters, the barking of the dogs, and the voices of
singing and rejoicing. Then at the Fonte Malliane a
magnificent banquet was prepared under the ilex woods
of a shady hill-side, not for the invited guests only,
but for all present. The Roman dames, with Catherine
mistress of the revel, mingling in their brilliant
and gorgeous-coloured<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> costume among the carousing
knights, amid the dark-green verdure that shaded the
hill-side, give what was wanted in colour to make the
gay scene perfect. At respectful distance amid the
surrounding woods, the Roman citizens are making the
most of the rare opportunity; not less loud in their
mirth, or less jovial over the good things provided at
the cost of taxes drawn by the good Count from faraway
provinces, than their masters. Their stalwart
forms, clad in russet jerkin or hempen frock, mingled
with hounds in leash, and richly-caparisoned horses,
group well as seen among the trunks of the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
against the dark background of the ilex woods. "It
is not to be told," says Jacopo, thus winding up his
unusually detailed description, "how much those German
chiefs, rejoicing after their own fashion, enjoyed
themselves on that memorable day!" Is it intended,
good Jacopo, by those words of yours, "<i>Germani illi
proceres lætantes more suo</i>," that we should catch a
glimpse of our Teuton friends riding back the eight
miles into Rome rather less steadily than they sat on
those tall horses of theirs in the morning?</p>

<p>Four days afterwards, at any rate, the Elector and
his company are ready to start on their homeward
journey; and the Pope, as a parting gift, presents them
with wax candles blessed by his own holy fingers: "so
that, accompanied by such holy things, they might
reach their own country in safety without any ill
encounters by the way."</p>

<p>Thus, amid honours, pleasures, and the agreeable
business arising out of her large share in the administion
of Papal favour, passed four brilliant years of the
heyday prime of Catherine's life. Was there no
darker woof to chequer the bright web&mdash;no shading to
so much sunlight? That terrible death-bed scene, when
Girolamo's cousin, Antonio Bassi, lay a-dying, has led
us already to the mention of the dark story of the Pazzi
murders. This celebrated episode of Florentine history,
which has been made again and again the
novelist's and poet's as well as the historian's subject,
is too well known for it to be necessary to do more
here than briefly recapitulate the familiar facts, especially
as the present story is only concerned with the
question, how far the Riarii were implicated in them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PAZZI CONSPIRACY.</div>

<p>On Easter day, the 26th of April, 1478, Lorenzo de
Medici, afterwards "the Magnificent," and his brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Giuliano were, while at worship before the high altar
of the Cathedral, stabbed by the daggers of assassins&mdash;Lorenzo
inefficiently, Giuliano mortally. Francesco
de Pazzi and his adherents were the murderers. A
Salviati, Archbishop of Pisa, was also one of the conspirators,
to whom had been assigned the part of
seizing the Palazzo Pubblico while the others did the
murder. The daggers of the assassins, however,
having done only half their work, and the populace of
Florence showing themselves in no wise inclined to
rise against the Medici, or make any demonstration
in favour of the conspirators, the game was lost.
Francesco and the numerous family of the Pazzi were
almost wholly exterminated; and the stout republicans
of Florence, having no fear of the Church before their
eyes, hung the Archbishop Salviati out of a window of
the Palazzo Pubblico in a very summary manner.</p>

<p>Now, that the great Florentine family of the Pazzi
should hate, worry, and conspire against the great Florentine
family of the Medici, was as intelligible, as
much according to the habitudes of the place and time,
and as natural, as that one butcher's mastiff should
fly at the throat of another. And if the deed of that
Easter Sunday had involved no other persons in its
causes and consequences, than the Medici and the
Pazzi, the destruction of the losing party would have
been the natural ending and completion of the story.
But, in the first place, an Archbishop had been publicly
hung in Florence;&mdash;a deed more difficult to be wiped
out, than the blood of scores of laymen, whether Medici
or Pazzi.  And, in the second place, the municipal and
commercial rivalry and hatred of those two families
had been exasperated and put into fatal action by being
involved with the yet more culpable hatred of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Riarii for the rival parvenu princes of the Medicean
race. Both Medici and Pazzi were bankers in Rome.
The former had held the lucrative appointment of
treasurers to the Apostolic chamber. Sixtus IV. took
this from them, and gave it to the Pazzi. These were
friends and allies of the Riarii. And there seems
no reason to doubt the assertion of the Florentine
writers, that Girolamo was one of the conspirators, if
not the original contriver of the whole scheme.</p>

<p>The Pope launched his interdict against Florence,
in punishment for the execution of the Archbishop;
and followed up this spiritual attack by a less formidable
secular one. The republicans were able to defend
themselves against the latter; but were obliged by the
former tremendous weapon to humiliate themselves
before the Papal throne. It is clear enough, in short,
that all the sympathies of the Pope after the deed were
with the perpetrators of it. Was he a consenting and
abetting party to it before the fact? This is a question,
which has occupied the attention and investigations
of historians, anxious to decide the matter according
to their respective prepossessions, more perhaps than its
importance deserves. One more crime, however dark,
added to the list of those which history has heaped up
at the door of the <i>Servi servorum</i>, can effect but little
any of the vexed questions raised between the defenders
and the accusers of Popes and Papacy. A synod
of the Tuscan prelates, which met in July of the year
1478, solemnly accused Sixtus of having instigated the
murder. The Florentine historians are nearly unanimous
in making the same accusation. And most of
the arguments on the point have been based on consideration
of this testimony. But we have less suspected
evidence to the same purpose in the direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
assertion of Stefano Infessura, the Roman diarist.
Having briefly told the circumstances and upshot of
the attempt, he adds:<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> "These things were ordered
by Pope Sixtus, together with the Count Girolamo,
and others, to take away the dominion [of Florence]
from Lorenzo de Medici, and give it to the Count
Girolamo." A moment's consideration of the mode in
which Sixtus and his son, or nephew, Girolamo,
worked in concert and pulled together during the
whole of his papacy for the founding and advancement
of the family greatness, and a little reflection on the
perfect confidence and community of aims and wishes
existing between them, will add all the weight which
extreme probability can give to the opinion that the
Pope was one of the conspirators.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPE PROBABLY IMPLICATED.</div>

<p>But then arises the question more nearly touching
the subject of these pages; What guilty knowledge
may Catherine have had of her husband's crime? Did
the young bridegroom, within the first year of his
married life, take counsel with his girl-wife, at that time
within a few weeks of having become for the first time
a mother at sixteen years of age, respecting this deed
of blood to be done for the furthering of their mutual
greatness? Did he seek to gratify her ambition,&mdash;certainly
no less worldly, less gross in quality, or less
a ruling passion than his own,&mdash;and obtain her admiring
smiles by laying at the proud beauty's feet these
high hopes to be realised at the price of a daring deed?
Or, when returning from dark plottings with priests and
desperate men in the most secret council closet of the
Papal palace to the brilliant home of his young wife,
did he mutter Macbeth-like, "Be innocent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
knowledge, dearest chuck, till thou applaud the deed"?
No written word survives to throw the least light on
this question. And each reader must judge of the
probabilities of the case according to his knowledge
and theories of human character. It was certainly
Riario's practice, as we shall see, to take counsel of his
wife in state matters of less unlawful kind. And
thoroughly does she seem to have been capable of
seconding and aiding in all the rough business that
might fall to the hand of a stirring and ambitious
prince in those unquiet times;&mdash;truly a help-meet for
one who had to hold his own by craft in the council-chamber,
as well as by energy and valour in the field.
Certainly, bearing in mind the character of the times,
and the character of the women, there can be small
doubt, that had Catherine found herself called to queen
it in fair Florence, she would have "applauded the
deed," that placed her there.... Yet ... at
sixteen, and at this period of her life at all events,
(however much we may at a later time find her wholly
busied in virile struggles for power and supreme
rule), occupied with the more womanly and more
holy cares of wife and mother-hood, it may be fairly
hoped that she was innocent of this black guilt,
despite the nearness of her connection with Heaven's
vicegerent!</p>

<p>During these four years in Rome, Catherine presented
her husband with three children. The first was a disappointment
to the ambitious pair. Bianca, a daughter,
born in March, 1478, was greeted, we may be sure, with
scant welcome. But on the 1st of September, 1479,
the long-sighted&mdash;yet so short-seeing&mdash;hopes of the
parents and of the Pontiff were gratified by the birth
of a son, christened Ottaviano. And on the 24th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
August, 1480, a second son, named Cesare, was born
to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A JOURNEY.</div>

<p>At length, in the summer of 1481, some brief pause
in the business of sharing the Papal councils, making
and breaking of leagues, persecuting the Colonnas, and
entertaining ambassadors, made it possible for Girolamo
and his wife to visit for the first time their dominions
of Forlì and Imola. There were to be grand
doings in Rome on the 30th of June, 1481. The Pope
in grand gala, and with much ceremony and great
rejoicings, was to bless the fleet, now coming up from
Ostia to the city. There were to be feasts, candles,
processions, and other such like "divine services,"
with "Florentine ambassador washing the Pope's hands
at the beginning of the sacred rites; Venetian ambassadors
washing them in the middle, and the Prefect of
Rome at the end of the same;"<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and drink and Papal
blessings distributed to all comers.</p>

<p>But, despite all these attractions, Girolamo and Catherine
with their retinue left Rome at daybreak on that
day. It caused great surprise, says the chronicler,
that they should not have chosen, at the cost of one
day's delay, to be present at all these gay doings. But
it was understood that that special day and hour had
been indicated to him as fortunate for his journey, by
the planets.</p>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">From Rome to Forlì with bag and baggage.&mdash;First presentation of a
new lord and lady to their lieges.&mdash;Venice again shows a velvet
paw to a second Riario.&mdash;Saffron-hill in brocade and ermine.&mdash;Sad
conduct on the part of our lieges.&mdash;Life in Rome again.&mdash;"Orso!
Orso!&mdash;Colonna! Colonna!"&mdash;A Pope's hate, and a Pope's vengeance.&mdash;Sixtus
finally loses the game.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Journeys in the fifteenth century were important
undertakings,&mdash;especially journeys of women and children.
But this expedition of the Count Girolamo and
his family was a very serious affair indeed. His departure
from Rome resembled a veritable exodus. For
he determined on transporting to Forlì, not only the
whole of his numerous establishment of servants and
retainers of all kinds, but also all his immense wealth
in goods and chattels of all sorts. This kind of property
formed a very much larger part of a rich man's substance
in those times, than it does in these days of public
debts and investments in all kinds of industrial undertakings.
A rich man's wealth in the fifteenth century
consisted of large masses of hoarded coin,&mdash;very much
smaller in numerical amount, however, than the sums
with which the traders and men of property of our day
are daily conversant,&mdash;of horses, and long trains of
richly caparisoned mules,&mdash;of large quantities of silks
and other rich stuffs, both for clothing and furniture,&mdash;of
arms and armour,&mdash;of jewels, and gold and silver
plate,&mdash;and of the various other articles of household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
plenishing. In all such things the Count Riario, who had
inherited all those rich possessions of his spendthrift
brother the Cardinal, which, we are assured,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> were for
their quantity and magnificence one of the wonders of
that age, was rich beyond any other individual of his
contemporaries. And all this vast mass of miscellaneous
property he now carried with him from Rome to
Forlì.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ALONG THE ROAD.</div>

<p>For eight days<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the long road by Orte, Terni, Spoleto
to Perugia, and thence over rough and picturesque
Apennine passes to Ancona, and so through the flat
and rich plains of Romagna to the distant provincial
city, was thronged with beasts of burden and vehicles,
and the servants and men-at-arms guarding them. As
far as the eye could reach from the highest tower-top
in Forlì over the straight dusty line of the ancient Via
Emilia, long strings of laden mules, and carts, might
be seen labouring onwards under the July sun, and, at
length, slowly passing under the city gateway into the
welcome shade of the narrow streets. Each mule load
was covered with an embroidered cloth, showing the
arms of Rovere and Sforza; and was bound with silken
cords; and each cart similarly protected. For eight
days the citizens of Forlì watched with ever-increasing
wonder the arrival within their little city of all this
wealth; and congratulated themselves on belonging to
a master, whose riches, they trusted, would have the
effect of making him less extortionate towards his new
subjects.</p>

<p>At Rome, meanwhile, much gossip and speculation
was excited by this departure of Girolamo, with bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and baggage; men observed, and whispered to each
other, that Sixtus was growing old, and was latterly
much broken. Some went so far as to assert, that his
death had been foretold as to occur in the July or
August of that year.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> At all events, the Pontiff could
not be expected to survive many years. And Rome,
always a turbulent and dangerous place for wealthy
men during the lawless interval between the death of
one Pope and the election of his successor, would be
like to be especially so to the immoderately enriched
kinsman of a very much hated Pontiff. It was surmised,
accordingly, that the prudent Count judged it
to be time to think of abandoning a falling house, and
preparing himself to ride out the storms which were
sure to follow the death of Sixtus, in the comparatively
safe anchorage of the provincial city he had
made his own, during the hay-making time of Papal
sunshine.</p>

<p>Catherine and her husband reached Forlì on the
15th of July, 1481, having been preceded by their children
and goods. Prepared by all they had witnessed
during the previous eight days, to expect something
very magnificent, indeed, when their hitherto unseen
lord should at length make his appearance, the citizens
of Forlì did their utmost to welcome their young
sovereigns. Nor, as it appears from the details of their
festal entry preserved to us,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> were the young couple
less anxious to impress their subjects favourably. All
the youth of both sexes, dressed uniformly in white,
and bearing olive branches in their hands, went out to
meet them, headed by the clergy and magistrates, in
full canonicals and robes of office. On meeting this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
procession, the Count and Countess descended from
their horses, and received their greetings standing.
Catherine, we are told, had decked herself for the occasion
in the most magnificent gala dress she possessed,
and had put on all her most precious pearls and
diamonds. "Her mind and intellect being filled
moreover with the choicest Roman manners," says
Burriel, "and joining to these her own elegance, and
select and polished diction, and dexterously taking
care, moreover, that the dazzling beauty of her personal
perfections was not hidden from the spectators,"
she made conquest at first sight of the eyes and hearts
of the Forlivesi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENTRY INTO FORLÌ.</div>

<p>Girolamo also did his best to make his entry as
imposing as possible; and came attended on his journey
by a party of the first nobles in Rome. It is very
curious, and strikingly indicative of the degree to which
Papal splendour outshone all other splendour in the
old capital of the world, and Papal favour lifted the
objects of it, be they what they might, far above all
other grandeurs and greatnesses, however proud, during
the brief period of a Pope's incumbency, to find this
low-born kinsman of a mendicant friar attended on his
journey by a Colonna,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> two princes of the Orsini, one
of the great Savelli family, and others of the oldest
patrician families of Rome.</p>

<p>Inside the city every sort of revelry prevailed for
three days. In the principal square of Forlì, admirably
adapted, say the Forlì writers, for such purposes,
from its handsome regularity and ample size, a tournament
was held, in which the Roman princes condescended
to run a course; and then a vast wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
castle, constructed in the middle of the square for this
purpose, was besieged and defended by two parties of
the townsfolk, with a reward from the Count to the
first of the besieging party who should enter it; a distinction
cheaply won by a Forlì youth, at the cost of
an eye poked out by the zeal of the defenders.</p>

<p>Then there was a magnificent ball, in which the
Count and Countess led off the dance, followed first by
the Roman guests, and then by all the "beau monde"
of Forlì. The chronicler, Leon Cobelli, who is recorded
to have been also a painter, musician, and ballet-master,
was there playing on his rebeck at the Count's
elbow; and winds up his account of the festival by
saying that he had never seen such a ball, and never
should again in his days.</p>

<p>There were, of course, triumphal arches, allegorical
paintings, cunning carpentry devices moving by unseen
means, eating, drinking, and speechifying, in prose and
verse, to a wonderful extent. "And charming it was
to see the Lady Countess and all her damsels come
forth in different magnificent dresses every day for a
whole week, and the great buffets, ten feet high, in the
banqueting hall of the palace, loaded every day with a
fresh service of silver and gold."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Every room in the
palace, too, was hung with tapestry, "however large,
and however irregular in form."</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEW BROOMS SWEEP CLEAN.</div>

<p>But the crowning joy of all was, when, on the occasion
of receiving the homage of the city, offered in "a
very elegant oration by Dr. Guido Peppi, a perfect
master not only of the vulgar tongue, but of Latin,
Greek, and Hebrew,"<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> the gracious Count was pleased
to remit the corn duties to his loving subjects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Forlì. Yet while relinquishing this important source
of revenue, the new sovereigns, at the same time, undertook
various expensive works for the amelioration and
improvement of their cities of Forlì and Imola. At
the former, the strong fortress of Ravaldino, commenced
by the preceding dynasty, was carried to completion.
The palace was enlarged and newly ornamented.
The public square was adorned with new
buildings and handsome porticoes. Schools were
established both there and at Imola. In the latter
city, such portions as had been built of mud were
destroyed, and rebuilt of stone. The public square
was enlarged and beautified, the paving of the streets
improved, and an Academy of Fine Arts instituted.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
In short, the young sovereigns seem to have been
really anxious for the well-being of the people committed
to their rule; and to have started at least with
some idea of having duties to perform, and some
intention of performing them.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>After thus winning golden opinions in Forlì,
Girolamo and Catherine left that city for their other
capital, Imola, on the 12th of August; having
sojourned among the Forlivesi a little less than a
month. There a similar welcome, and similar gala
doings on a somewhat smaller scale, awaited them.
There also their time was as busily occupied in making
beneficent arrangements for the improvement of the
town, and in striving to obtain the affections of their
subjects; and their stay as short. For Girolamo was
called away from these duties and interests more
properly his own, by the necessity of attending to
affairs of the Pope, which made it necessary for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
to visit Venice. For this purpose he left Imola together
with Catherine, on the 2nd of September, after a stay
there of three weeks only.</p>

<p>All Italy was filled with uneasy suspicions and
jealousies at this visit of the Pope's nephew, favourite,
general and right-hand-man-in-ordinary to the powerful
republic. Every little court was on thorns, and
had spies on the alert to ascertain if possible the
object and the degree of success attending the move.
All sorts of things were suspected, asserted, and
chattered of by these busy gentry; and subsequent
historians have had to pick a somewhat thorny path
amid their contradictory statements.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The most
probable, and indeed scarcely doubtful explanation of
the matter seems, however, sufficiently simple.</p>

<p>The Turks were in possession of Otranto. The
Turkish raids were the constant terror and bugbear of
Italy in these centuries, as were those of the Danes
to our own island at an earlier period. Like the
Danish inroads too to our monarchs, the aggressions
of the Turks were sometimes a motive, and constantly
a pretext to the popes for raising troops and money,
and requiring the assistance of the other states of
Italy. The Venetians had in the year before granted
no such aid to Sixtus against the infidels. To obtain
the promise of such now from the Signory was the
avowed motive of the Count's visit. But no Italian
potentate ever believed anything that was avowed.
Besides, whenever the Pope was bent on hiding the
real causes of movements, whose true scope was some
iniquitous spoliation or ambitious scheme, he always
had the Turks in his mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">FELONS IN ERMINE.</div>

<p>Now for the real motive. Hercules, Duke of
Ferrara, had quarrelled with the Venetians. He was
also in disgrace with Sixtus. In the war, which had
ensued between the Pope and Florence, in consequence
of the Pazzi affair, and the hanging of the Archbishop
of Pisa, Duke Hercules had accepted the place of
General on the Florentine side. For which highly
irreligious conduct Heaven's vicar had excommunicated
him, and declared him deprived of his dukedom.
Hercules of Ferrara however declared, that excommunicated
he might be, but that Duke of Ferrara he
would live and die by the grace of his own right arm.</p>

<p>The business in hand therefore between Sixtus and
the Republic was first to unite their force for the
destruction of this audacious rebel, and then to decide
who was to have the spoil. The Republic said they
would have Ferrara;&mdash;and meant it. The Pope said
that it should belong to the Church; but meant, that
it should fall to the lot of Girolamo, and form the
main pillar of that edifice of family greatness, for
which Sixtus lived and laboured.</p>

<p>But in stating the high policy of princes with this
naked brutality,&mdash;into which the necessity of brevity
has betrayed the writer&mdash;there is a danger, that perverse
and ill-constituted idiosyncrasies may picture to
themselves Counts, high and mighty Signors, and even
Heaven's Vicegerent himself under the figure and
similitude of some Bill Sikes, Artful Dodger, and
reverend Fagin contending with mutually deceptive
intentions respecting some equally nobly won booty.
It becomes the historian therefore to lose no time
in having recourse to those means, which the time-honoured
practice and general consent of the world have
appointed for the decorous draping and nobilitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
similar passages of history. Bill Sikes in Doge's
bonnet and ermine cloak, a venerable Fagin duly
tiara-ed and apostolically elected, and an Artful Dodger
in knightly guise, with a lovely and brilliant she-dodger
by his side, gracefully going through decorous festivities
in ducal halls in the midst of admiring satellites,
will offend no proprieties.</p>

<p>Hasten we then to the all-potent upholstery, which
decently differences the monarch and the burglar.</p>

<p>Of these Venetian festivities, it so happens, that our
old Roman friend Jacopo of Volterra has left us the
account of an eye-witness. Taking a rare holiday
from diary-writing in the capital of the world, he had
gone, he tells us,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> to visit certain relations at Lucca.
And thence, led by the desire of seeing the world,
"videndi studio," he visited Bologna, Ferrara, and
Padua. In the latter city he heard that the Count
Girolamo and his noble lady had just arrived at
Venice, having passed not by the route of Padua, but
by Comacchio and the marshes, for the sake of avoiding
Ferrara. So our curious Jacopo, who like a gadabout
gossip as he was, could not resist the temptation
of being present on such an occasion, left his horses
with the innkeeper at Padua; and hiring a boat on the
Brenta, sailed for Venice&mdash;"Navigavi Venetias."</p>

<p>The day after his arrival was Sunday, on which
day at noon "the noble Virgins of Venice, to the
number of an hundred and thirty-two, all, if not
equally beautiful, equally loaded with gems, gold,
and pearls, offered the Count, in the great hall of the
ducal palace, a most magnificent spectacle, worthy of
being remembered throughout all time." Giovanni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Mocenigo, the Doge, sat on a lofty dais between
Girolamo and Catherine. All the nobility of Venice
were ranged tier above tier around the hall, in such
numbers, that Jacopo never remembered having seen
such an assembly even at Rome, except on occasion of
the jubilee. Dancing was kept up till it was dark.
Then white wax-candles were lighted in such numbers
that night became more brilliant than day. Games of
various kinds were then exhibited till the fourth hour
after sunset. Then the feasting began&mdash;feasting of
which it was difficult to say whether quantity or quality
were the more wonderful! The women's dresses,
"<i>ut a peritis intelligo</i>,"&mdash;as I am given to understand
by such as are up in such matters, were estimated to
be worth three hundred thousand gold pieces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FESTIVALS AT VENICE.</div>

<p>Other particulars of the doings at Venice on this
occasion, and of the great honour shown to the Count
by the Signory, have been preserved in a letter<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> by the
Archdeacon of Forlì, to Lorenzo de' Medici, from the
tone of which it should seem that, although in the
suite of his sovereign, his real business at Venice was
to act as spy for Lorenzo. This good Archdeacon
tells his correspondent that it cannot be denied that
the Signory have treated the Count in the most distinguished
manner, that any prince was ever treated
by them in the memory of man. He relates how forty
noble citizens were sent to meet him at Malamocco;
how the Senators themselves, with the Doge on board
the Bucentaur, and an hundred and fifteen noble ladies
to do honour to the Countess Catherine, came out to
St. Clement in the Lagoon, two miles from Venice,
and escorted him into the city, with every possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
mark of respect and rejoicing; how the Doge received
him the next day standing at the foot of the Giant's
staircase; how he had been created "Gentilhuomo di
Venezia;" and how the Senate had assembled and
proceeded in his presence to transact certain business,
in order that he might see their mode of procedure.
Notwithstanding all which, adds this traitor Archdeacon,
and clever spy, "I am certain that this visit has produced
no fruit, which need give umbrage to your
Lordship, or our other friends. Nor am I by any
means sorry that it has taken place; as I know, that
despite all this show of respect, the Count has seen
here certain things, which have been discouraging to
him rather than otherwise."</p>

<p>And, indeed, the experience of his brother the Cardinal's
visit to Venice, and its results, ought to have
been sufficient to warn Girolamo, that the grave Senators
of the Republic were not unwont to laugh in their
sleeves, while fooling vain young courtiers to the top
of their bent with all sorts of external honours and
gala-making, and sending them away wholly unsped,
as regarded the substantial objects of their mission.
How far Count Girolamo, and Catherine on whose
counsel, we are told, he relied much on occasion of this
visit to Venice, having taken her thither for the express
purpose of availing himself of it, were contented with
the result of their negotiations, we have no means of
knowing, though Burriel undertakes to say, that he
was highly dissatisfied. But it will be seen in the
sequel, that Lorenzo's correspondent, the Archdeacon,
had found the means of arriving at a very correct
opinion of the real intentions of the Venetian statesmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSPIRACIES.</div>

<p>The Count and Countess reached Imola on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
return on the 23rd of September, and remained there
till the 9th of October. While still busy there, according
to the historians, in making various provisions for
the amelioration of their territories and the benefit of
their subjects, they received news from Forlì of the
discovery of a dangerous conspiracy for the purpose of
restoring the dynasty of the Ordelaffi. The conspirators
proposed to assassinate Girolamo on his journey
from Imola to Forlì; and then with the help of the
Lord of Faenza, who was an uncle of the banished
Ordelaffi, of the Lord of Bologna, and above all of
Lorenzo de' Medici, who had by no means forgotten
the ill turn he owed the Riarii, to secure the city for its
ancient masters.</p>

<p>It is upon the occasion of this conspiracy that we
learn, for the first time, from the reluctant admission
of the historians, that two others having the same
object had already been crushed by the vigilance of
Francesco Tolentino, governor of Forlì, in the course
of the year 1480, before the new sovereign had yet
visited his principality. On both these occasions the
clergy implicated in them had been exiled for a while,
and the laymen hung in the orthodox manner.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> And
now the turbulent artisans of Forlì are trying again
the same desperate game. The only consolation to the
feelings of the injured sovereigns, was to be found in
the fact, says Burriel, that no noble was engaged in the
affair. Happily our vigilant Tolentino has the leaders
of the conspiracy safe in the fort of Ravaldino before
any mischief is done, beyond the painful effect of so
much ingratitude on the feelings of the gracious sovereigns.</p>

<p>The historians are diffuse in indignant moralising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
on this "ingratitude," and perverseness. It seems
true, indeed, that Girolamo and Catherine showed
themselves inclined to govern according to the best
extant lights of state-craft. But these writers omit to
remember, that the Riarii were usurpers; and that the
ousted family, and old familiar name, with its three
centuries of history clinging round it, now represented
by two young men, known to the Forlì artisans only by
their unmerited misfortunes, were sure in absence and
exile to be remembered with affection, and associated
with a thousand "good-old-times" recollections, more
potent over the minds of ignorantly patriotic burghers,
than modern fiscal reforms. The Ordelaffi pretenders
have no biographers except their enemies; and we must
trust therefore to our imaginations for their view of
these recurring conspiracies.</p>

<p>The Count and Countess hastened to Forlì on hearing
these tidings from Tolentino. All danger was however
over; and Girolamo with magnanimous clemency&mdash;much
praised by his biographer&mdash;gave orders that
no vengeance should be inflicted ... till after he
had left Forlì.</p>

<p>This he immediately did, starting for Rome with
Catherine on the 14th of October. And ten days afterwards,
the good people of Forlì received the necessary
lesson from the sight of four corpses dangling from as
many windows of the <i>Palazzo Pubblico</i>.</p>

<p>The second residence in Rome, which followed this
return in October, 1481, was characterised by events of
a very different kind from those which had imparted
so festive a character to those first four years. In the
early days of his Papacy, the efforts of Sixtus to turn
his elevation to account in the only manner in which it
was valuable to him, had been crowned with success by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the establishment of his son&mdash;or nephew&mdash;as prince of
the third-rate states of Forlì and Imola. The bolder
attempt, which followed, to acquire for him the dominion
of Florence at the expense of so much black and
odious guilt had, as has been seen, not only failed, but
had entailed on Italy two years of war. And now the
same undying ambition and insatiable avarice was driving
him into the still greater misfortunes, which resulted
from his endeavours to appropriate the dukedom of
Ferrara.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITALIAN POLITICS IN 1481.</div>

<p>Though much discontented with Girolamo's failure
in the object of his visit to Venice, in as much as the
Signory, while giving him abundance of fair words, had
steadily evaded any engagement as to relinquishing
their pretentions to Ferrara, when its Duke should be
driven out by their joint forces, Sixtus, nevertheless,
determined on continuing his alliance with them, in
the hope that, when the prey was hunted down, he
might find the means of appropriating it to himself.
The Venetian Senators were doubtless guided in their
secret counsels by similar considerations.</p>

<p>Every effort was at first made at Rome to conceal
the existence of such an understanding; and the Pope
was in public loud in his abuse of the Republic. But
Ferdinand, the crafty and cautious old King of Naples,
was not to be taken in by any such means. And the
first consequence of the Pope's policy was the necessity
of sending troops with Girolamo at their head to the
Neapolitan frontier to oppose the hostile movements of
the Neapolitans, who, under the command of Alfonzo,
the King's son, threatened to force their way through
the Roman states, for the purpose of going to the assistance
of the Duke of Ferrara. Most of the other
states of Italy, as usual, joined in the quarrel; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
greater potentates for the protection of their own, or
the hope of acquiring new dominions; and the lesser,
as usual, in the capacity of mercenaries and "condottieri"
captains. Thus all Italy was in a state of war
and confusion.</p>

<p>In order to meet Alfonzo with as powerful a force as
possible, Girolamo sent to his trusty governor,
Tolentino, to come from Forlì, and bring with him as
strong a band of Forlivesi as he could raise. The
Bishop Magnani was appointed governor in his absence.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
But his reverence, frightened at the remembrance of
former conspiracies, and seeing ground of suspicion in
everything, so used his authority, imprisoning, confiscating,
and racking the lieges, even to death, right and
left, that the commander of the fortress, after fruitlessly
remonstrating with the bishop, wrote to Girolamo, that
if he wished to preserve his position in Forlì, he must
lose no time in putting a stop to the proceedings of his
churchman governor. So Tolentino had to be sent
back in a hurry.</p>

<p>At length, on the 21st of August, 1482, Girolamo at
the head of the Papal troops, and the celebrated
"condottiere," Robert Malatesta, at the head of the
Venetians, gave battle to the Neapolitans near Velletri,
and won a victory over them. The success, such as it
was, produced no very important or decisive consequences;
but of course the utmost was made of it at
Rome. Girolamo marched into the city in triumph, and
prisoners and standards were paraded and presented to
his lady Countess, who must have felt, thinks Burriel,
that this was the happiest day in her life. It may well
be doubted, however, whether Catherine felt much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
happiness on the occasion, though she no doubt played
her sovereign part before the public eye as well on that
day as on so many others. She had little cause for
happiness. Things were not looking well for her and
hers in those days. News had recently been received
of the siege of Forlì by some of the allies of the Duke
of Ferrara; and though the attack had been beaten
off, mischief had been done: there was expense to be
incurred, and future danger to be feared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREAT SCARCITY.</div>

<p>Rome itself, moreover, was by no means a place to
be happy in during these latter years of Sixtus IV.'s
Papacy. The scarcity of all necessaries was extreme,
the distress very great, and the discontent threatening.
A large portion of the Papal force, however much
needed in the field, was obliged to be retained in Rome
for fear of a rising of the people. Wine was hardly to
be procured. Many taverns were shut up, from absolute
impossibility of obtaining food and drink to offer
their customers.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Grain was at an unprecedented
price; and the bakers were compelled, under pain of
fine and imprisonment, to purchase their supplies at
granaries established by the Pope, for the storing of
inferior corn imported by him at a low price from
Naples, and sold at an enormous profit. And the
bread made from this grain, says Infessura,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> "was
black, stinking, and abominable, eaten only from necessity,
and the cause of much disease."</p>

<p>Another misfortune was the death of the great
soldier Robert Malatesta, who survived his Velletri
victory only fifteen days. He died in Rome, in all probability
of fever caused by his exertions in the battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
But public rumour, as usual, spoke of poison, and
attributed his death to Girolamo's jealousy of his
share in the command of the forces. Such accusations
are of interest only as indicative of the motives which
the public mind of the time deemed with probability
attributable to its great men, and of the deeds which
were considered likely to have been perpetrated.</p>

<p>He was buried in the church of St. Peter with all
honour, "with sixty-four torches and many banners and
many standards, of which one bore his arms and this
motto: '<i>Veni, vidi, vici; victoriam Sixto dedi; Mors
invidit gloriæ</i>;' and a catafalque as if he had been a
pope."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The more mordant contemporary diarist,
Infessura, in recording these funeral honours, writes
that once upon a time Siena having been liberated
from the Florentines by some great captain, the Sienese
were at a great loss what honours and recompense to
award him. Whereupon a citizen rose and said, "Let
us put him to death, and then worship him as a saint,
and so make him our perpetual protector;" which was
accordingly done. "Now, it is said&mdash;not that I altogether
believe it," honestly adds Infessura, who bitterly
hated Sixtus&mdash;"that the Pope imitated these Sienese
in the matter of Malatesta's death and the honours
shown to his dead body."</p>

<p>Many curious indications of the strange disorder
and wretched state of Rome during these years may
be gleaned from the prolix daily notices of these
laborious old diarists.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of January, 1483, died "the poor old
Cardinal de Rohan, who was robbed in life and robbed
in death. For just before his death, Messer Bernardo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
de' Massimi" (a scion of a princely house!) "broke
into his dwelling through the church of St. Apollinare,
and robbed it of thirty thousand ducats' worth of
richly wrought plate, with which he got clear off to
Venice. And when the body was being carried to his
burial, the friars of St. Augustin fought with the friars
of Santa Maria Maggiore for certain gold brocade with
which the corpse was covered, and belaboured each
other with the torches. And then there was such a
row that swords were drawn, and the rings that the
corpse had on its fingers and the mitre on its head
were stolen."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROMAN ANECDOTES.</div>

<p>Here is another queer little picture furnished by the
same anonymous "Notary of Nantiporto:"</p>

<p>One of the great Savelli family, the Signor Mariano,
is a prisoner in St. Angelo. One night, the 25th of
July, 1483, the cardinal-governor of the castle, the
constable and other authorities are supping in the
garden behind the fortress; and after supper sit playing
cards till three in the morning. While they are
thus engaged, Signor Mariano contrives to escape from
the prison. At four <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, armed men are searching all
Rome for him, in vain; for he is safe out of the city.
A bad business for the convives of that pleasant
supper and card party; for that same day, Pope Sixtus,
who does not like his prisoners to escape him, goes in
person and in a great passion to St. Angelo, "and
stayed there almost the whole day, and drove out the
governor and the constable and the whole of the rest
of the party."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards we have the following anecdote
preserved for us by Stefano Infessura:</p>

<p>A certain youth, one Messer Gianantonio di Parma,
a deformed hunchback, and "monster of a man,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
grossly ignorant besides, and of infamous character,
had paid down two hundred and fifty ducats to Count
Girolamo, and promised a thousand to the Pope for a
place. So Sixtus sends this promising youth to the
Auditors of the Rota, the highest, most learned, and
most respected legal body in Rome, with orders to
admit him at once as one of their number! The
members of that court demurred; humbly pointing out
that it was contrary to all law and custom to appoint as
Auditor of the Rota one not qualified by the usual
preparatory degrees and examinations. The Pope, in
reply, ordered a body of guards to march down to the
court, and take all the members prisoners. But that
grave and learned body, having received notice of what
was coming, quickly broke up their sitting, and "stole
off secretly, every man to his own house, not by the
direct way, but by Trastevere, for fear of being caught
and taken to prison." Hereupon Messer Gianantonio,
baulked of his place, demanded his two hundred and
fifty ducats back again from the Count. But it by no
means suited that magnanimous Prince to refund. So
he angrily answered that the money had been an
unconditional gift! In which characteristic story, it is
doubtful whether the Pope's audacious attempt, in
despite of all law, decency, and reason, or the apparent
ease with which the Papal vengeance was escaped, is
the more strange.</p>

<p>But nothing is more curiously indicative of the
disjointed state of society, and general disorder prevailing
in these times, than the frequent apparent
powerlessness of rulers wielding despotic authority to
do as they would with things immediately, as it should
seem, beneath their hand. Nothing works regularly.
Appointed forces abdicate their functions; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
position of the baulked autocrat puts one in mind of
that of the old woman of the nursery rhyme: "Fire
won't burn rope,&mdash;rope won't hang man;" and the
despot can't get over the small stile that impedes the
path of his wishes. The immediate instruments of
the tyrant's will, act as if he were a bad child or dangerous
madman. If his orders can be evaded, or
escaped from for the day, it is probable that the
morrow may find him busy with some new freak of
power. As there is no inviolable law, there is no
certain line of demarcation between the criminal and
the correct citizen. And all the mass of society is
prepared to oppose at least such inert resistance as it
can with safety, to the unreasonable will of an unrespected
master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRAITS OF MANNERS.</div>

<p>Another curious trait of manners has been preserved
by two of the diarists so frequently cited.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Girolamo
had besieged and driven out the Colonnas from one of
their castles in the neighbourhood of Rome. This
achievement was of course made much of in the city;
and a young painter, one Antonio, son of Giuliano,
made the bombardment the subject of a picture. All
the fight was, we are told, painted to the life with its
various incidents and episodes. But in one corner of
the picture, the painter, in one of those whimsical
moods so often indulged in by the artists of that day,
had represented<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> a lady in closer conversation with a
Franciscan friar than was consistent with strict propriety.
The painting was talked of; and to the poor
painter's great delight, the Pope desired to see it.
Sixtus was at first much pleased; but then observing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
two figures above mentioned, he took it into his head
that the lady was intended to represent the Countess
Catherine. Whereupon, without further ado, he ordered
the painter to be put on the rack, and then hung,&mdash;his
house to be sacked, and all his and his father's
substance confiscated. All of which was done,
except the hanging, for which exile was substituted,
on the pretext that the offender was little better than
crazy.</p>

<p>The constant cause, however, of the worst and most
frequent of the disorders that then rendered Rome
little better than a den of outlaws and anarchy, was the
great feud between the Colonnas and the Orsini, in
which the Pope and Girolamo warmly espoused the side
of the latter. No pretext was too flimsy, no injustice
too flagrant, no violence too lawless, for these rulers
to commit, in pursuit of the utter ruin of the hated
family.</p>

<p>At length, on the 29th of March, 1484, there was
"such work in Rome, as I never saw the like in my
day,"<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> says the Notary of Nantiporto. All the Orsini
and Girolamo Riario with them, armed themselves for
a night attack on the palaces of the Colonnas, with the
especial purpose of destroying the Protonotary Colonna,
the head of that family. They, well knowing of the
intended attack, which was in no wise kept secret,
made the best preparations for defence that they could,
barricading the streets with loads of hay and beams,
&amp;c. Thus, during that whole day, "Rome was in
great trouble, and every one was in arms." Every
body made their own dwelling as secure as possible;
and "I," says the Notary, "put two carts full of stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
before my door, and shored it up well with beams, and
did the same to the windows; and all night long I
heard them crying on the bridge, 'Orso! Orso!
Chiesa! Chiesa!' with much sounding of trumpets,
and continual discharges of fire-arms."</p>

<div class="sidenote">DOWN WITH THE COLONNA!</div>

<p>The magistrates of Rome, the "Conservatori," the
Senators, the "Caporioni," and many notable citizens,
went to the Pope in the midst of the tumult, to
endeavour to bring about a pacification. But the
fierce and vindictive old man would hear of no terms
of submission or reconciliation till the Protonotary
should give himself up into his hands. There was
little doubt what would be the result of such a
step. But the Colonna, seeing that it was the only
chance of appeasing the storm that threatened to
destroy his whole race, at length declared that he
would go to the Pope. The other members of his
family, however, would not permit him to do so; but
determined that he should pass the night in the house
of the Cardinal Colonna, his kinsman.</p>

<p>That night, after a regular bombardment, in the
course of which many lives were lost on both sides, the
houses both of the Cardinal and the Protonotary were
taken by assault, and given up to pillage. The dwellings
of many private citizens were also sacked in the
tumult and confusion. At last, the Protonotary surrendered
to Virgilio Orsini, who, together with the
Count Girolamo, dragged him off to the Pope. As for
the Cardinal, "all that he possessed was given up to
plunder; his gold and silver, his robes, rich tapestry,
and household goods, even to his hat."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> As Virgilio
Orsini and Girolamo Riario took the Protonotary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
through the streets, the Count made several attempts
to put an end to their prisoner with his arquebuss,
but was prevented by Orsini. "Ah! ah! traitor,"
screamed the Count to his enemy, "when I get you
into my hands I will hang you by the neck."</p>

<p>The Pope ordered him to be taken to St. Angelo;
and there Girolamo did get him into his hands. The
torments to which he was subjected in those secret
thick-walled torture chambers, are described as horrible.
"At last," writes Infessura,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> goaded by his
feelings into the unwonted eloquence of irony, "the
most holy Father in Christ, our Lord and Master,
together with his accomplice, the Count Girolamo,
according to their innate and wonted clemency, mercy,
and justice, which they have ever shown, and still show,
towards the faithful sons of holy Mother Church, have
given us a crowning proof of their admirable qualities
and hearts. For the medical men summoned by themselves
to the prison of the Protonotary Colonna, have
declared, that the varied and most excruciating tortures
to which he has been subjected, have made it
impossible that he should live." He then proceeds to
give a detailed account, according to the report of the
surgeons, of the injuries inflicted on every part of
the unfortunate man's body, which, curious as it is
in its indications of the scientific ingenuity of the torturers,
is too painful for reproduction.</p>

<p>But though the Colonna was dying, he did not die
fast enough. On the 30th of June, therefore, the
anniversary, as Infessura remarks, of the decapitation
of St. Paul by Nero, "His Holiness, our Lord and
Master, inflicted a similar fate on the Protonotary."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
The mutilated body was then dressed in vile and
grotesque rags in mockery of his late rank and state,
and so sent to his mother. "And I, Stefano Infessura,
the writer of this history, saw it with these eyes, and
buried his body with these hands! For no other
citizen of the Colonna faction would meddle in the
matter, as I suppose, from fear."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PAPAL HORIZON DARKENS.</div>

<p>It is to be observed therefore that our chronicler
was evidently a warm partizan of the persecuted
family. But his narrative has all the characteristics
of truthfulness as to its facts. Whenever any ill-deed
of the opposite faction rests only on common report,
or suspicion, he records the accusation, but always
marks it as only a report. Besides that he is in the
main perfectly corroborated by the apparently impartial
Notary of Nantiporto.</p>

<p>After the death of the Protonotary the Colonnas
attempted by submission to make peace with Sixtus,
so as to preserve some remnant of the family possessions.
But Sixtus, though trembling on the verge of
the grave himself, would hear of no peace or reconciliation
as long as there remained anything belonging
to a Colonna, which might be wrenched from them for
the enriching of a Riario.</p>

<p>Yet the horizon was daily growing darker around
the fortunes and long-cherished hope and aims of the
rapidly declining Pontiff. Some months previously to
the events just related, he had found himself forced to
change suddenly and scandalously his policy with
regard to the Venetians. As soon as their success
against the Duke of Ferrara seemed imminent, almost
all the other states of Italy became seriously alarmed
at the prospect of so great an accession of territory
and power to the great Republic already so formidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
to its neighbours. They united in urging these views
on the Pope, who seems to have become aware about
the same time, that if the Venetians conquered, they
would conquer for themselves, and that in such case he
would have no chance of obtaining the coveted dukedom.
He therefore suddenly united himself with the
other states in a "santissima lega," against Venice,
still intending to direct its forces also against Ferrara,
and hoping thus to win the prize he could not bring
himself to relinquish.</p>

<p>Rarely has been seen a more striking instance of
that strangely interesting but painful spectacle of an
unworthy ruling passion strong in death, than that
offered by the dying Sixtus. For what had he prostituted
to mean aims the awful powers and solemn
position intrusted to him? for what wholly disregarded
every most dread responsibility; brought scandal,
disgrace, and scoffing on his great office; and made
the title of Heaven's Vicegerent a blasphemy? for
what had he plunged Italy into war, and made Rome a
bandit's lair? For a name!&mdash;a name that a few years
before had been borne from father to son by unknown
fishermen, happy in their obscurity! That his "family"
might be great among the great ones of the earth!&mdash;the
family of a mendicant friar and sworn Romish
priest!</p>

<p>This was the one passion for which Sixtus IV.
lived, and sinned, and died. Yes! died for it. For
the misery of failure in his hope was the malady that
crushed him into the grave. The game was going all
against him. For as all Italy was united in the
determination that Venice should not possess Ferrara,
and the Republic saw clearly that she could never
succeed in taking it in defiance of them all, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
little obstacle to the peace Italy so much needed. But
the Holy Father (!) would hear of no peace. Each
courier that brought news from the camp, which
indicated the probability of such a solution, inflicted
a blow that prostrated him. He was seen by the few
who had access to him, plunged in deep melancholy,
and totally unable to rally his failing strength.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE'S DEATH.</div>

<p>At length came envoys with the news that peace was
made;&mdash;made without consent, intervention, or stipulation
of his! The messengers with decorously
malicious hypocrisy, pretended to think that they were
the bearers of acceptable tidings,&mdash;enlarged on the
blessings thus secured to Italy, which must be so
consolatory to the paternal heart of the father of the
faithful, and congratulated him on the prospect of
durable repose opened to the bleeding country. Every
word was a rankling stab to the heart of the despairing
but still implacable Pontiff. Willingly would he have
clutched with those shaking hands, which he was
compelled to raise in hypocritical benediction, the
throats of these babblers of peace and reconciliation.
But the blow was fatal to the sinking old man.
Ferrara and its fair dukedom would never now belong
to kith or kin of his. So Sixtus turned his face to the
wall and died.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p class="pn p2">Yet, to a certain extent, Sixtus had done his work
and attained the desire of his heart. The "family" <i>was</i>
founded, though not with all the splendour and all the
guarantees for durability which he so ardently wished.
The poor Franciscan monk's long studious vigils in
his lonely cell, unquenchable ambition, hard upward
struggle, patient self-denial in the acquirement of the
reputation that was to be his ladder, and audacious
spurning of that ladder when the height was won, had
obtained the desired reward. The name of Riario was
written among those of the princes of Italy. And all
those deep theological readings, so well and earnestly
pursued as to have made this poor friar the "greatest
theologian of the day," "profound casuist," confessor,
doctor, general of all Franciscans, and finally, apostolically
chosen head of all Christ's Church, never led him
to doubt the adequacy of such reward in return for a
soul smirched, and moral nature degraded! Well! we
must not attempt to weigh in our nineteenth-century
atmosphere the deeds done, and still less, the thoughts
conceived in the grosser fifteenth-century air, or presume
to judge even a pernicious Pope. But for his "theology,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
his science of God.... I think that there are some
materials here for forming a judgment of that.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CATHERINE'S ENERGY.</div>

<p>The "noble" family had got founded. From base-born
father and base-born mother, very unexceptionably
legitimate and "noble," princes had been born by due
application of properly paid sacerdotal rites at proper
times and seasons. Strange to think of! And now
the business in hand was only to keep what had been
gained, to "defend our legitimate position, and the
birthright of our children." And that holding our own
without an apostolic uncle, may be more difficult than
was the making it our own with that assistance.</p>

<p>In truth, the difference between the position of Girolamo
and his wife, as long as the breath of life lingered
in the nostrils of the terrible old man, and that which it
became the instant that breath had departed was tremendous.
The fall was a stunning one.</p>

<p>But Catherine was not stunned. Though alone in
Rome at that critical moment&mdash;for Girolamo was with
the troops engaged in driving the Colonnas out of their
fastnesses in the neighbourhood of the city&mdash;she
showed herself, on this her first meeting with difficulty
and danger, as promptly energetic and as equal to the
emergency as she did on many a subsequent not less
trying occasion. Anticipating the more tardy action
of the Sacred College, now the only existing authority
in Rome, she threw herself into the Castle of St.
Angelo, and taking possession of it in the name of her
husband, as Commander of the Forces, found there a
safe asylum for herself and children, during the first
outburst of anarchy that followed the Pontiff's death.</p>

<p>The step was by no means a stronger one than the
necessities of the case required. When Girolamo
returned to Rome on the 14th, he found his home a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
ruin. The state of Rome was like that of a city given
up to pillage. The streets were filled with citizens
carrying property of all sorts hither and thither, in the
endeavour to find some comparatively safe place of
stowage for it. Those who had just sacked the houses
of others were as much at a loss to preserve their
plunder as the more legitimate owners were to save their
property. All who were in any wise connected with
the Riarii were of course more especially exposed to
danger. The large magazines belonging to a certain
Giovanni Battista Pallavicini, a brother-in-law of
Count Girolamo, which had for several years escaped,
by fraudulent connivance, from all visits of the tax-gatherer,
were utterly gutted. The mob found in
them, we are specially told,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> all the wax intended for
the obsequies of the Pontiff, a large quantity of alum,
and much quicksilver. The Genoese merchants, of
whom there were many at Rome, were particularly
obnoxious to the mob, as countrymen of the deceased
Pope. But little property of value was found in the
Count's palace. We have seen it all prudently packed
off in time to Forlì. But the mob revenged themselves
for their disappointment by almost destroying the house
itself. Marble doorways and window-cases were
wrenched from the walls, and carried off. What could
not be removed was destroyed. The green-houses,
and even the trees in the gardens, were utterly devastated.
One mob rushed out of the city to a farm
belonging to the Count in the neighbourhood, and
there made booty of a hundred cows, as many goats,
and a great number of pigs, asses, geese, and poultry,
which belonged, says Infessura, to the Countess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Other indications of our heroine's good house-keeping
were found in enormous stores of salt meat, round
Parma cheeses, and very large quantities of Greek
wine. The huge granaries, also, from which Sixtus
had derived so unrighteous a gain, fell, of course, an
easy prey to the plunderers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEAVES ROME.</div>

<p>By the 22nd of August the Sacred College had succeeded
in some degree in restoring Rome to a condition
of not more than usual disorder. On that day Girolamo
formally undertook to give up into the hands of
the Cardinals, the castle and all the fortresses of the
Church&mdash;but not till they had consented to discharge
his little bill of 4000 ducats for arrears of pay as
General of the forces.</p>

<p>It would seem, however, as if his active and energetic
partner had conceived at the last moment some idea of
maintaining her position in St. Angelo contrary to her
husband's undertaking&mdash;probably until the result of
the coming election should be ascertained. For the
College was informed, that during the night between
the 24th and the 25th, which had been fixed for the
handing over of the fortress, a hundred and fifty armed
men had been quietly marched into it. The Cardinals
were exceedingly indignant at this breach of good
faith. It must be concluded, however, that Catherine,
strong-hearted as she was, did not find herself sufficiently
strong for the contest she clearly seems to have
meditated. For Infessura concludes the incident by
saying that "the Cardinals, nevertheless, took care that
the Countess with all her family, and with the said
hundred and fifty men at arms, should evacuate the
Castle on the 25th," as had been stipulated.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on that day, she and Girolamo left
Rome, and arrived at Forlì on the 4th of September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 29th, while they were still on their journey,
Cardinal Cibo was created Pope by the name of Innocent
VIII.</p>

<p>The news of this election was most important and most
welcome to the sovereigns of Forlì; for Innocent VIII.
had been most materially assisted in his elevation by
the two Riario Cardinals, one the cousin and the other
the nephew of Girolamo. Infessura lets us into quite
enough of the secrets of the Conclave which elected
Innocent VIII., to make it clear how grossly simoniacal
was their choice&mdash;an affair of unblushing bargain and
barter altogether. And it may be safely concluded
that Girolamo and his fortunes were not forgotten in
the agreement for the price of the voices of the Cardinals
his kinsmen.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the fourth day after their arrival at
Forlì, arrived three documents, executed in due form:
the first recognising and confirming the Count's investiture,
with the principalities of Forlì and Imola; the
second continuing his appointment as General of the
Apostolic forces; and the third dispensing with the residence
in Rome which his office in usual course entailed.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding these great points gained, the
position of Girolamo and Catherine was a difficult one,
and very different indeed from what it had been at the
period of their last arrival in their capital. On this
occasion we hear nothing of festal processions and olive
branches, of balls, tournaments, or speechifications. The
Forlivesi, doubtless, already appreciated by anticipation
the great difference, soon to be more vividly brought
home to them, between belonging to an enormously
wealthy Papal favourite, who had the means of freely
spending among them a portion of the immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
revenues derived from sources which in no way wrung
<i>their</i> withers, and being the subjects of a needy prince,
who expected to draw from them the principal part of
his income.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DANGERS IN THE PATH.</div>

<p>Besides, the abortive attempts to increase his possessions,
which had formed the leading object of his
life for the last eight years, had most materially contributed
to increase the difficulties of holding what he
<i>had</i> acquired under his present changed circumstances.
Lorenzo de' Medici, at Florence, whom he had failed to
assassinate, Hercules d'Este, at Ferrara, whom he had
failed to drive from his dukedom by force, and the
Venetians whom Sixtus had suddenly jilted the year
before to ally himself with their enemies, and had then
excommunicated, were none of them likely to be very
cordial or safe neighbours, and were not unlikely to
lend a favourable ear, and, under the rose, a helping
hand to those persevering Ordelaffi youths, who were
always in search of some such means of recovering the
heritage of their ancestors.</p>

<p>Thus the four years following the death of Sixtus
were little else for Girolamo and Catherine, than a
period of continually increasing difficulty and struggle.
To the sources of trouble indicated above Girolamo
soon added by his imprudence another, which in the
sequel led to consequences still more fatal. At the
time of the Pope's death he had, as may easily be
imagined from some little indications we have had of
his theory and practice of administration of the Papal
affairs, a very considerable sum of ready money in his
hands. But for the last thirteen years of his life his
command of resources had been practically almost
unlimited; and he was wholly unused to the necessity
of abstaining from what he wished on account of considerations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of cost. He was a man of magnificent
and expensive tastes; and like his apostolic kinsman,
had especially that, most fatal to the pocket, of
building. At the same time, the extremely distressed
state of the people of his principalities at the period of
his second arrival among them from Rome, arising
from the war and the consequently neglected state of
industry and agriculture, made it absolutely necessary
to do something for their relief. Girolamo remitted
the tax on meat; and at the same time launched out
into great and costly building enterprises.</p>

<p>Besides enlarging and beautifying their own residence,
and raising the fine vaulting of the cathedral,
which still remains to testify to the skill of the builders
and the ungrudging orders of their employers, the
Count and Countess completed the fortress of Ravaldino<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
on a greatly increased scale of magnificence and
cost. It was now made capable of accommodating
2000 men-at-arms, besides containing magnificent
apartments for their own dwelling in case of need,
immense storehouses of all sorts, and last, though very
far from least in importance, ample prisons. Then,
again, there were certain ugly Pazzi and Colonna
reminiscences, which made it only common prudence
to invest a considerable sum in building a convent or
two, considering, as our modern insurance offices remind
us, the uncertainty of life. So a Franciscan
cloister, and a nunnery of Santa Maria were built "con
incredible spesa," says Burriel. The former tumbled
down when just finished, and had to be built a second
time. Let us hope, that the catastrophe was not due
to any unhandsome attempt at palming off cheap work
on "the recording angel."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">HER YOUNGER CHILDREN.</div>

<p>All these various sources of expenditure in a short
time reduced the Count from being a rich man, to the
condition of a poor and embarrassed one. This led
him to the re-imposition of the taxes he had taken off.
And the latter step led to the very unpleasant results
indeed, which the sequel of the present chapter has
to tell.</p>

<p>In the meantime Catherine presented her husband
with three other sons. Her fourth child, and third
son, was born on the 30th of October, 1484, and
named Giorgio Livio. A fourth was born on the 18th
of December, 1485; and a fifth on the 17th of August,
1487. The second of these was christened Galeazzo,
after Catherine's father; and it is worth noticing, that
one of the child's sponsors at the baptismal font was
the envoy sent to the court of Forlì by Lorenzo de'
Medici. Now, we have abundant evidence that the
feelings of Lorenzo were anything but friendly to
Girolamo, as indeed it was hardly to be expected that
they could have been. And this public friend-like
manifestation is an instance of a kind constantly recurring
in Italian history, of the mode in which the
"<i>viso sciolto, pensieri stretti</i>" wisdom was carried into
practice, that is far less pleasing to trans-Alpine barbarians
than to the Macchiavelli and Guicciardini
schooled statesmen of Italy.</p>

<p>From this Galeazzo descend, it may be noted, the
present family of the Riarii.</p>

<p>Catherine's sixth child was christened Francesco
Sforza, and was generally known by the familiar
diminutive Sforzino.</p>

<p>There would be neither instruction nor amusement
to be got from reading page after page filled with
detailed accounts of the various occasions on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the chronic state of conspiracy against the Riarii burst
out ever and anon into overt acts, during these years.
Correspondence was well known to be actively kept up
by the Ordelaffi with their friends within the city; and
every now and then some butter woman, or friar, or
countryman driving a pig into market, was caught with
letters in his possession, and had to be hung. Then
would occur attempts at insurrection, which occasioned
fines and banishment, and beheading and hanging upon
a larger scale. And the historians adverse to the Riarii
assert that he hung and beheaded too much, and could
expect no love from subjects thus treated; while the
writers of opposite sympathies maintain, that he hung
and beheaded so mildly and moderately, that the
Forlìvesi were monsters of ingratitude not to love and
honour so good a prince.</p>

<p>Thus matters go on, perceptibly getting from bad to
worse. Cash runs very low in the princely coffers, and
the meat tax has to be re-imposed, occasioning a degree
of discontent and disaffection altogether disproportioned
to the gratitude obtained by its previous repeal. Unceasing
vigilance has to be practised, stimulated by the
princely but uncomfortable feeling, that every man
approaching is as likely as not to be intent on murdering
you. Girolamo and his Countess, one or other,
or both, have to rush from Forlì to Imola, and from
Imola to Forlì, at a moment's notice, for the prompt
stamping out of some dangerous spark of tumult or
insurrection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HARD LIFE.</div>

<p>In a word, this business of great family-founding on
another man's foundations seems to have entailed a
sufficiently hard life on those engaged in it. And
though that "last infirmity of noble (?) minds," which
prompts so much ignoble feeling, and engenders so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
many ignoble actions, vexing as it did their prince,
vexed also the cultivators of the rich alluvial fields
around Forlì by corn taxes, salt taxes, meat taxes, and
other "redevances," yet on the whole it may be well
supposed that "fallentis semita vitæ" at the plough
tail had the best of it, despite occasional danger from
the summary justice of the <i>Castellano</i> of Ravaldino.
That black care, which rode so inseparably and so hard
behind the harassed prince backwards and forwards
between Forlì and Imola, did more than keep the
balance even between hempen jerkin and damasqued
coat of mail; and the least enviable man in Forlì and
its county was in all probability the founder of the
greatness of the Riarii.</p>

<p>One consolation, however, this hard-worked prince
had in all his troubles, and that perhaps the greatest
that a man can have. His wife was in every way truly
a help meet for him. Catherine was the very <i>belle
idéale</i> of a sovereign châtelaine in that stormy fifteenth
century. Her aims and ambitions were those of her
husband; and she was ever ready in sunshine or in
storm to take her full share of the burden of the day;
and, indeed, in time of trouble and danger, far more
than what was even then deemed a woman's share in
meeting and overcoming them. Dark to all those
higher and nobler views of human morals and human
conduct which have since been slowly emerging, and
are still struggling into recognition, as we must suppose
that vigorous intelligence and strong-willed heart
to have been, nourished as it was only on such
teaching, direct and indirect, as "ages of faith" could
supply, still Catherine had that in her, which, if it may
fail to conciliate our love, must yet command our
respect, even in the nineteenth century. From what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
she deemed to be her duty, as far as we can discern,
this strong, proud, energetic, courageous, masterful
woman never shrank. And it led her on many a
trying occasion into by no means rose-strewed paths.
Her duty, as she understood it, was by all means of all
sorts,&mdash;by subtle counsel when craft was needed, by
lavished smiles where smiles were current, by fastuous
magnificence where magnificence could impose, by energetic
action when the crisis required it, by gracious
condescension when that might avail, by high-handed
right-royal domineering when such was more efficacious,
by fearlessly meeting peril and resolutely
labouring, to aid and abet her husband in taking and
holding a place among the sovereign princes of Italy,
and to preserve the same, when she was left to do so
single-handed for her children. And this duty Catherine
performed with a high heart, a strong hand, and an indomitable
will, throwing herself wholly into the turbulent
objective life before her, and perfectly unmolested
by any subjective examination of the nature of the
passions which conveniently enough seemed to range
themselves on the side of duty, or doubt-begetting
speculations as to the veritable value of the aims
before her and the quality of the means needed for
the attainment of them.</p>

<p>In March, 1487, Catherine went to visit her relations
and connections at Milan, leaving her husband at
Imola; but had been there a very few weeks when she
was hurriedly summoned to return. Girolamo had
been seized with sudden and alarming illness at Imola.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Catherine reached his bedside on the 31st of May, and
found him given over by his medical attendants. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
judged, however, that he had not been properly treated,
and lost no time in obtaining the best medical advice in
Italy, we are told,&mdash;from Milan, Ferrara, and Bologna.
She also nursed him indefatigably herself, and had the
gratification of seeing him slowly recover.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NEW CASTELLANO.</div>

<p>While he was still unable to leave his chamber
alarming news arrived from Forlì. The faithful
Tolentino had died some time previously, and one
Melchior Zocchejo, of Savona, had been appointed
<i>Castellano</i> of Ravaldino. This man is described<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> as
having been previously a corsair, and as being a most
ferocious and brutal man, worthless, moreover, in all
respects. The seneschal of the palace at Forlì at this
time was a certain Innocenzio Codronchi, an old and
faithful adherent of the Riarii. He had made a sort
of intimacy with Zocchejo, as a brother chess-player,
and used to go into the fortress frequently to play
with him, for the duties of the <i>Castellano</i> did not
permit him ever to leave the fort for an hour. This
same impossibility made, it seems, an excuse for the
seneschal to offer to send a dinner into the fort, since
he could return the governor's hospitality in no other
way. Introducing thus several bravoes in the guise of
servants, Codronchi suddenly poinarded Zocchejo at
table, and with the assistance of his men seized the
fort.</p>

<p>It was supposed at once in Forlì, that, old retainer
of the family as Codronchi was, he had been gained by
the Ordelaffi; and that the fortress, and in all probability
the city also, was consequently lost. The consternation
was great; and a messenger, despatched in
all haste to Imola, reached the sick room of the Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
late at night with these alarming tidings. He was still
too far from well to leave his room. Catherine was
expecting her fifth confinement every day. Still the
matter was too urgent to be neglected. She at once
got into the saddle; and by midnight that night was
before the gate of Fort Ravaldino in Forlì, summoning
Codronchi to give an account of his conduct.</p>

<p>"Dearest lady," replied the seneschal,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> appearing
on the battlements, and speaking thence to his mistress
below, "the fortress should not have been entrusted to
the hands of such a man as the governor, a worthless
drunkard. To-night I can say no more than this. Go,
I entreat, and seek repose, and to-morrow return here
to breakfast with us in the fort."</p>

<p>Old servants, it must be supposed, occasionally take
strange liberties in all climes and ages; but certainly
this address does, under the circumstances of the case,
seem one of the strangest.</p>

<p>Catherine, with one attendant before the closed
gates of her castle at midnight, had nothing for it but
to do as this audacious seneschal advised her. The
next morning she went according to invitation, carrying
with her, we are told, the materials for an excellent
breakfast. But on reaching again the still closely
barred gates of Ravaldino, the lady was told from the
battlements, that she herself, and the breakfast, with
one servant to carry it would be admitted, but no more.
If matters looked bad before, this insolent proposition
certainly gave them a much worse appearance; and
made it very necessary for the Countess to reflect well
before acceding to it. If indeed the seneschal had
been bought by the Ordelaffi, his conduct was intelligible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
enough, and her fate would be sealed if she
trusted herself within the fortress. It might be, however,
that Codronchi, alarmed at the daring step he
had taken, was only thinking of providing for the
immediate safety of his own neck from the first burst
of his mistress's wrath, when he refused to admit any
followers with her. Again, it might be that he was
wavering in his allegiance, and might yet be confirmed
in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BOLD STEP.</div>

<p>Catherine, after a few minutes of reflection, decided
in opposition to the strongly urged advice of her counsellors
in the city, on accepting the man's terms; and
she and the breakfast and one groom passed into the
fortress. All Forlì was, meanwhile, on the tip-toe of
anxious expectation for the result. Of what passed at
this odd breakfast, we have no means of knowing
anything, inasmuch as the citizens of Forlì, including
the writers who have chronicled the strange story,
remained then and ever after in perfect ignorance on
the subject. Catherine, we are told, shortly came
forth, and summoning to her one Tommaso Feo, a
trusted friend of her own, returned with him into the
fortress. And Codronchi immediately gave over the
command of it into his hands; which done, he and
Catherine, leaving Feo as <i>Castellano</i>, came away
together to the Palazzo Pubblico of Forlì, where a
great crowd of the citizens were waiting to hear the
result of these extraordinary events.</p>

<p>The Countess, however, spoke "only a few mysterious
words" to the crowd. "Know, my men of Forlì,"
said she, "that Ravaldino was lost to me and to the
city by the means of this Innocenzio here; but I have
recovered it; and have left it in right trusty hands."
And the seneschal voluntarily confirmed what the lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
said, remarking that it was true enough! Whereupon
this self-confessed traitor and the Countess mounted
their horses, and rode away to Imola together,
apparently in perfect understanding with each other!
"And the next morning, two hours after sunrise,
Catherine gave birth, without any untoward accident
whatever, to a fine healthy boy."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The whole of which queer story, reading as it does,
more like a sort of Puss-in-boots nursery tale than a bit of
real matter-of-fact history, gives us a very curious peep
at the sort of duties and risks these little sovereigns of
a city and its territory had to meet, and the sort of
footing on which they often were obliged to stand with
their dependants.</p>

<p>This night-ride to Forlì, too, may under all the circumstances
of the case be cited in justification of the
assertion, that our dashing, vigorous, little scrupulous
heroine, had some stuff of fine quality in her after all.
And it was on the eve of being yet more severely tried.</p>

<p>Girolamo had recovered and returned with Catherine
to Forlì. Being hardly pressed for money, he had
farmed out the much-hated meat-tax to one Checco, of
the Orsi family, to whom he appears to have owed
considerable arrears of pay for military service. Checco
d'Orsi wanted, not unreasonably, to stop the arrears
due to him out of the sum coming to the Prince from
the tax. But this did not suit the Prince's calculations,
and he threatened the noble Orsi with imprisonment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MURTHER!</div>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding these sources of ill-feeling, the
Count seems to have received him courteously, when
on the evening of the 14th of April, 1488, he presented
himself at the Prince's usual hour of granting audiences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
It was after supper, and Catherine had retired to "her
secret bower," a point of much importance to Checco
d'Orsi and his friends. Entering the palace they
made sure that the business in hand should not be
interrupted by interference of hers, by placing a couple
of their number at the foot of the turret stair which led
to her private apartments. The others passing on to
the great hall,&mdash;Sala dei Ninfi,&mdash;they found Girolamo
leaning with one elbow on the sill of the great window
looking on to the Piazza Grande, and talking with his
Chancellor.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> There was one servant also in the further
part of the hall.</p>

<p>"How goes it, Checco mio?" said he, putting out
his hand kindly.</p>

<p>"That way goes it!" replied his murderer, stabbing
him mortally as he uttered the words.</p>

<p>So Catherine became a widow with six children, at
twenty-six years of age.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The corpse of the murdered man lay tranquilly on
the pavement of that vast "Hall of the Nymphs,"
surrounded by the hangings of arras, and sideboards of
plate "ten feet high," the produce of many a deed of
rapine, oppression, and wrong; tranquilly and free, for
some five minutes past now, from troublous thoughts of
meat-taxes, empty coffers, Ordelaffi conspiracies, and
revolutions, for the first time these four years! It lay
near the great window, and the thick blood flowed
slowly over the painted brick floor, making a dark
stain, which Forlì tradition could still point out to
curious strangers towards the end of the last century.
The affrighted servant, who it seems was one Ludovico
Ercolani, a butler, long in the service of the Riarii,
had run from the hall, to carry the terrible tidings to
the distant chamber of the Countess. And for a few
short minutes the murderers, Checco d'Orsi and his
accomplices, Giacomo Ronchi and Ludovico Pansecco,
stood alone over their victim, with pallid faces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
starting eyeballs, taking rapid counsel as to what was
next to be done.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LIBERTY! LIBERTY!</div>

<p>This ruffian Pansecco, one of the historians quietly
remarks, had been employed by the Count on occasion
of the Pazzi murders.</p>

<p>Those moments were anxious ones to the doers of
the desperate deed, for all depended on the feeling,
with which the populace might at the first blush regard
it. Their anxiety was not of long duration, however.
From the open window the three assassins cried to
the people in the Piazza "Liberty! Liberty! The
tyrant is dead! Forlì is its own mistress!" It was
the evening hour at which every Italian, then as now,
is out of doors enjoying the fresh air, and chatting with
neighbours, sitting in groups in front of the druggists'
shops&mdash;(a curiously universal and time-honoured habit
in the provincial cities of Italy), or walking to and fro
in the principal square; and the news, therefore, ran
through the city with the quickness of lightning. In
an instant the Piazza was crowded with citizens, crying,
"An Orso! an Orso! Liberty! Liberty!" and the
conspirators were safe&mdash;for the present.</p>

<p>The palace guard lost no time in providing for their
own safety, by separating and mingling with the people.
Ludovico d'Orsi, Checco's brother, a doctor of law and
whilome senator at Rome, who had been guarding the
stair leading to Catherine's apartments, went out into
the Piazza to excite and direct the mob. But the
Chancellor, who had been with the Count at the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the murder, had meanwhile reached Catherine's room
by another passage. Her younger children and their
nurses, and a young sister of hers, named Stella, whom
she was about to marry advantageously to a certain
Andrea Ricci, were with her. And the confusion in
that room, full of women and children, on the abrupt
and breathless telling of such news may be easily
imagined. But Catherine, with infinite promptitude
of thought, ordered Ludovico to hasten, without
losing a moment by lingering with them, to the castle;
and to tell Feo, the governor, from her, to send off
instant couriers to her brother, the Duke, at Milan,
and to her husband's friend and ally, Bentivoglio,
Lord of Bologna.</p>

<p>Catherine, and the women with her, barred the door
behind him as best they might with heavy furniture
and so forth. But he had hardly had time to get clear
of the palace before Checco with half-a-dozen ruffians
were thundering at the Countess's room, and in a
very few minutes had forced an entrance. The chroniclers
have noted that Orsi could not bring himself
at that moment to face Catherine. He remained at
the door, while the men he had brought with him
made the women understand that they must come with
them.</p>

<p>And thus the family of the murdered sovereign were
marched through the crowded streets of the city to the
Orsi palace, and there locked up as prisoners.</p>

<p>That done, the conspirators hastily called together
the leading men in the city, to decide on the steps to
be taken for the government of it henceforth. For the
Orsi, wealthy, numerous, influential, and violent as
they were, had no hope of being permitted to make
themselves lords of Forlì. They proposed, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the step which promised the next best chances for
their own greatness and power,&mdash;to lay Forlì at the feet
of the Pontiff. This was frequently a measure adopted
in those days in similar circumstances. The crime
committed would be thus wiped out; the family of the
murdered prince, and the neighbouring princes, who
might be disposed to profit by the occasion, would be
kept at bay; and, since the Church could only hold and
govern and tax distant dependencies by means of
governors and lieutenants, who so likely to step into
such profitable places, as the powerful citizen who had
gained the new state for the Holy Father?</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CARDINAL SAVELLI.</div>

<p>The frightened council at once assented to the
proposal, and sent off that same night messengers
to the Cardinal Savelli, who was residing as governor
for the Church at Cesena, a city about twelve miles to
the south of Forlì.</p>

<p>Meanwhile some of the partisans of the Orsi had
thrown the body of Girolamo from the window into
the Piazza; and while the citizens were busied in
displaying everywhere the papal flag, amid cries of
"Chiesà! Chiesà!" the mob having torn every rag
of clothing from the corpse, dragged it through the
streets of the city, till certain friars took it from them,
and placed it in the sacristy of their church.</p>

<p>The Cardinal Savelli did not at all like the proposal
made to him; and lost some important time, before,
"being unwilling to have it said that the Church had
lost a chance through his cowardice," he at last made
up his mind to accept it. On arriving at Forlì, his
first step was to visit Catherine in the Orsi Palace.
An historical novelist would have little difficulty, and
better historical warranty than often suffices for such
purposes, in presenting his readers with a sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
striking and picturesque account of that interview.
Catherine, the historians tell us, was, as we might
expect from our knowledge of her, haughty, unbroken,
and unbending; the Cardinal, as we might also expect
from our knowledge of his kind, smooth-tongued,
courteous, full of regrets and talk about his sacred
duty to Holy Mother Church. This is all history
tells us. But it is enough. The imagination has no
difficulty in filling up the sketch.</p>

<p>But at the conclusion of his courteous talking, the
Cardinal intimated, that it would be better, that the
Countess and her family should for the present find a
safe shelter in a small but strong building over the
St. Peter's gateway, under the care of trusty citizens,
to be named by his Eminence. And Catherine was
far from unwilling to acquiesce in the change. For
though the accommodation proposed to her was
materially of the most wretched, yet she naturally
preferred any prison to the home of her husband's
murderer; and the Cardinal's hint, that the gateway
prison might be a safer asylum for her and her children
than the palace of the Orsi, was, she felt, more than a
mere pretext.</p>

<p>That night, accordingly, the 15th of April, Catherine
and her family were marched through the city, escorted
by a troop of guards, bearing torches, from the Orsi
palace to her new prison. The little procession of
prisoners consisted of twelve persons; the Countess
herself, her mother (who is now mentioned for the first
time since her daughter's birth, and who may in all
probability be supposed to have become Catherine's
inmate at the time of her settling permanently in Forlì
after the death of Sixtus), her sister Stella, her six
children, a natural son of the Count, named Scipio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and two nurses. They were received with all courtesy
by the three citizens to whose keeping the Cardinal
had consigned them; but suffered much from the
insufficiency of the small room to hold them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEFORE THE FORTRESS.</div>

<p>The next day Cardinal Savelli and the conspirators
summoned Feo, the Governor of Ravaldino, to deliver
up the fortress; and on his refusal, they brought
Catherine from her prison to the foot of the walls, and
there compelled her to give her own orders <i>viva voce</i>
to the <i>Castellano</i> to do so. On his showing himself on
the ramparts, she not only commanded, but implored
him with every possible appearance of earnestness, to
save her life by delivering up the fort. In all probability
the Countess and her <i>Castellano</i> perfectly understood
each other. In any case he knew Catherine's
character, and had, moreover, the orders which had
reached him by Ercolani for his guidance. At all
events, he replied to her commands and entreaties by a
steady refusal; and the baffled conspirators had to
take her back to the gate-house.</p>

<p>"Ah, Madame Catherine," said Giacomo Ronchi,
one of three who had murdered the Count, and who
stood by her side as she parleyed with Feo, "if you
were really in earnest, he would yield. But it is you,
who do not wish him to obey your words; and it
makes me long to lay you dead where you stand with
a thrust of this partizan through the body!"</p>

<p>This, writes Cobelli, the ballet-master historian, I
heard, who was there, listening and seeing everything
in order to record it faithfully.</p>

<p>That night the faithful Ercolani contrived to gain
admittance to his mistress in her prison; and it was
then concerted, that if, as she anticipated, she were
again taken to the fort on the morrow, to repeat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
scheme which had that day failed, she should attempt
to obtain permission to enter the fortress. To this
end, Ercolani was to communicate with Feo with the
utmost secrecy, and give him the necessary instructions
for playing into Catherine's hands. He was to seek an
interview with the Cardinal also, and endeavour to
persuade him by feigning anxiety on account of the
danger to Catherine from the governor's obstinacy,
that the surest means of inducing him to yield would
be to allow her to speak to him within the castle. He
knew both parties well enough, he assured his Eminence,
to feel certain, that Feo would not be able to resist his
mistress, when brought face to face with her.</p>

<p>The Cardinal had lately had that honour, and was
inclined to think the statement probable enough.</p>

<p>The following day, Catherine, as she had expected,
was again taken to the foot of the ramparts of the
fortress by the conspirators, accompanied this time
by Savelli; and the <i>Castellano</i> was again called to
parley.</p>

<p>The comedy of yesterday having been again performed
between them, the Cardinal demanded of the
governor, whether he would obey his lady, if she
were to enter the fortress, and there give him the same
orders, so that he could have no pretext for supposing
that she was acting under constraint. To this Feo
replied, that he could not say what he might do under
such circumstances, but should endeavour to act up to
what should then seem to be his duty. On her part,
Catherine declared, that she was sure she could induce
him to yield, if only she could be permitted to speak to
him privately.</p>

<p>The Orsi and their friends were strongly against
letting her out of their hands, although she reminded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
them that she left her children as hostages in their
power. Cardinal Savelli, however, was for allowing
her to go in, and his counsel prevailed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHAT WILL SHE DO?</div>

<p>Catherine was permitted to enter the fortress alone,
on the agreed understanding, that, successful or not in
prevailing upon the governor, she was to come forth
again in three hours.</p>

<p>Very exciting was the interest which kept all parties
in the city on the tip-toe of expectation during these
important three hours. Both among the well-wishers
of the Countess, and among her enemies, opposite
opinions prevailed as to the probabilities of the issue.
Money to a great extent would have changed hands on
the event, had the scene been enacted among our bet-loving
countrymen. The Forlìvesi passed the time in
ceaseless debate as to the course which the lady might,
could, would, or should adopt. The space before the
ramparts of the castle remained crowded with anxious
groups of talking citizens during the whole of the
appointed interval. And the Orsi, and their more
immediate allies, consoled their shrewd misgivings,
that their victim had escaped them, by dark threats
as to the fate of her children.</p>

<p>At length, the great bell on the Piazza told all Forlì
that the three hours were over. All rushed towards
the castle to witness the variously expected event.
The sitting groups sprang to their feet; and a sudden
silence succeeded to the roar of a whole city's chatter,
when, in obedience to a summons from a trumpet, Feo
appeared on the battlements. And it is easy to imagine
the burst of varied passions, which again broke forth
into a storm of voices, when that officer, with most
untroubled coolness, told them, that:&mdash;</p>

<p>"His liege lady was much fatigued by what she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
had gone through; that immediately on her entry into
the fort, he had counselled her to seek repose; and
that she was now, in fact, enjoying a sound sleep, from
which he could not think of disturbing her. That, as
to her quitting the fortress of Ravaldino in the present
state of her city of Forlì, he, governor of that fortress,
judged it safer for her not to do so; and, therefore, be
her own intentions what they might, when she should
awake from her slumbers, he should in no wise permit
her to go forth."</p>

<p>And so saying, the <i>Castellano</i>, calm, in the secure
consciousness of the perfect strength of his walls,
retreated into their shelter.</p>

<p>His Eminence the Cardinal Savelli was angry enough
at the dupery which had been practised on him. But
the Orsi, to whom the matter in hand was a question
of life, station, and property, were transported with
fury. Some of them hastened off to the gate-house
prison, and soon returned with Catherine's children.
The imperturbable <i>Castellano</i> was again summoned to
his ramparts, and ordered to inform the Countess<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
that the lives of her children depended on the instant
performance of her compact.</p>

<p>Again he replied, that he would do nothing of the
kind. As to the children, who were there below in
the hands of their father's assassins, in mortal terror
enough, poor things, and naturally urging the governor
with very earnest and sincere entreaties to give up
the fort and save their lives, he would merely advise
the citizens of Forlì to reflect a little before they
suffered a hair of their heads to be hurt. He reminded
them, that these children were the nephews of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
powerful and neighbouring Duke of Milan, that the
Lord of Bologna, still nearer at hand, was their ally
and connection; and told them to ask of themselves
whether, in the case of their cold-blooded murder, it
was not likely that the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah
might be tolerable compared with that, which would fall
on Forlì.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A VETERAN REVOLUTIONIST.</div>

<p>The Cardinal Savelli, angry and provoked as he was,
had certainly no intention of really staining his hands
with these children's blood. The body of the citizens
felt the truth of what Feo had said; and eventually the
boys and their sister were carried back to their prison
unhurt, though the Orsi and their accomplices were,
says Burriel, gnashing their teeth with baffled fury.</p>

<p>On the evening of that day, the 16th, while the Orsi
and their friends were at supper, and engaged in
anxious discussion as to the next steps to be taken,
their father, who had retired from the city to his
country house a little before the murder of the Count,
returned to the Orsi palace. He was eighty-five years
old, and in revolutionary matters certainly might well
be deemed a high authority, for this was the seventh
insurrection in which he had been engaged in Forlì.
In all the troubles, which had preceded the expulsion
of the Ordelaffi, as well as in all those which had
succeeded the usurpation of the Riarii, this turbulent
old noble had always taken a leading part. Now,
drawing various examples from the treasures of his
long experience, the old man severely blamed his sons
for leaving their work half done. Either they ought to
have never ventured on such a step as putting the
Count to death, or they ought to have extinguished his
entire family. As it was, he augured ill of the future,
and feared that the having let Catherine escape into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
fortress perfectly impregnable by any means at their
command, would prove an irremediable and fatal error.</p>

<p>It was determined among them to send off messengers
to Rome that night, to lay the obedience of the
city at the feet of the Pontiff, and urge him to send
immediate assistance in troops and munitions.</p>

<p>The 17th was occupied in hostilities, which caused
much mischief and suffering in the city, without the
least advancing any solution of the position. The
Cardinal Legate brought up from Cesena all the troops
he could collect under the pontifical banner; but they
had no efficient means of attacking Ravaldino. On the
other hand, Feo bombarded the town, and left marks
still pointed out centuries afterwards; and caused
many catastrophes, the subject of Forlì traditional
talk for many a year. But still nothing decisive was
accomplished.</p>

<p>On the 18th, a herald from Bentivoglio, Prince of
Bologna, arrived in Forlì, and was received by Savelli
and the heads of the revolutionary party in the town
hall. He came, he said, in the first place, to warn the
citizens on the part of his master, on pain of certain
and entire destruction of their city, to do no harm to
the children of the murdered Count; and secondly, to
demand that Catherine should be placed in liberty,
and Octavian, the eldest son of Girolamo, proclaimed
Count of Forlì.</p>

<p>To these demands Savelli replied, that for the
children there was nothing to be feared: they were
in perfect safety. As to the Countess, she was in
perfect liberty as far as the city authorities were concerned;
and all that was asked of her was to give up
the citadel and depart in peace. But as for proclaiming
the late Count's heir, sovereign of Forlì, that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
wholly out of the question, even if the city wished to
do so; inasmuch as they had already declared themselves
the Pope's subjects, and had sent an embassy to
Rome to lay their city and their fealty at the feet of
his Holiness. With which answer the herald retired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ORSI AFFAIR LOOKS BLUE.</div>

<p>But the mere appearance of this messenger from the
Lord of Bologna had produced an effect upon several
of the citizens, which must have warned the conspirators
how little they could depend upon the steadiness
or support of the people. Many began to murmur
against those who, they already surmised, might be
ultimately on the losing side; and Savelli and the Orsi
had to send many suspected of adhering to the Riarii
out of the city.</p>

<p>Catherine's sister Stella was taken from the Gatehouse
prison to the bedside of her betrothed husband
Ricci, who was laid up by wounds he had received in
the fighting that had occurred in the palace immediately
after the murder; and having been there
married to him, was permitted to depart to Cesena in
company with her mother Lucretia.</p>

<p>During this day, too, the Orsi, becoming more and
more painfully anxious about the issue of their enterprise,
sent a letter to Lorenzo de' Medici, asking his
support against the family of his old enemy. But on
the 19th, the messenger came back, bringing only a
verbal answer from Lorenzo, to the effect that he had
no surviving resentment on account of by-gone matters
to gratify&mdash;that he had no inclination to meddle in
such an affair as that proposed to him; and that he
hoped and purposed to pass the remainder of his days
in quiet.</p>

<p>On the 20th, arrived two letters from the Duke of
Milan, one to Savelli, and one to the Comunità of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Forlì. In the first the Duke expressed his astonishment
that the Cardinal should have ventured to take
possession of Forlì, not merely without any commission
from his Holiness, but, as there was every
reason to believe, before any knowledge of the recent
events had reached the Papal court. He admonished
his Eminence, that he was acting in open disregard of
all law and every principle of justice; and concluded
by very pointedly advising him, as he would avoid
further misfortunes, to return forthwith to his own
affairs at Cesena. The letter to the Comunità in much
the same terms advised the citizens, as the only means
of confining the consequences of the late excesses to
the immediate authors of them, to send away the
Cardinal, and return at once to their allegiance.</p>

<p>Savelli began to find himself in a difficult and disagreeable
position, and resolved on taking a strong, and
what would appear to our ideas a dangerous step.
Since nothing came from Rome, neither troops, nor
authority of any kind for what he had done in the
Pope's name, his Eminence determined to forge the
letter so urgently needed. He accordingly produced a
bull, which he declared had just reached him from
Rome, by which his Holiness thanked the Forlìvesi
for their affection towards the Church, accepted the
allegiance of the city, and promised to send troops
with speed to support them in the course they had
taken. The fraud was, however, but partially successful
for the moment; for many, we are told, doubted of
the authenticity of this bull from the first.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOPES AND FEARS.</div>

<p>The next day things looked still worse for the conspirators
and their ecclesiastical patron. Two heralds
from Bentivoglio, and the Duke of Milan, rode into the
great square of Forlì, and publicly before the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
demanded, in the name of the Duke of Milan, that the
children of the late Count should be immediately
brought to him; announcing further, that a strong
force was then on its march, and already within a
short distance of the city. Checco d'Orsi, who received
them, replied with the utmost insolence and audacity,
that the children had already been put to death, and
that Forlì feared neither Bentivoglio nor the Duke of
Milan, as the Pope's troops would be there to help
them before the Milanese could reach the city. How
much of this was mere bravado, and how much inspired
by real hope of succour from Rome, it is difficult to
say. But it became clear afterwards, that Innocent
VIII., who was a very different man from the aggressive
Franciscan his predecessor, had turned a completely
deaf ear to the proposals of the Forlìvesi, and the
communications of his own legate; being determined, as
it should seem, in no wise to interfere in the matter.
Indeed, when the over-zealous legate Savelli was afterwards
within an inch of being hung by Catherine for
his share in the revolution, Innocent abstained from all
interference even by remonstrance in his favour.</p>

<p>Thus matters went on till the 29th, the Milanese and
Bolognese troops gradually drawing near to the city,
and Savelli and the Orsi becoming daily more discouraged
and alarmed at the non-appearance of the
expected assistance from the Pope. Once the sentine
on the top of the tower of the Palazzo Pubblico
declared, that he saw troops coming towards the city
from the southward; and the news in an instant put
the declining cause of the conspirators once again in
the ascendant with the fickle populace. The whole
city was ringing with cries of "Orso! Orso! Chiesà!
Chiesà!" when it was discovered that the supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Papal army was a body of fifty horsemen coming to the
assistance of the Countess; and the affections of the
Forlì lieges again began to lean towards their old
masters accordingly.</p>

<p>Meantime Savelli battered the citadel with cannon
brought from Cesena and Forlimpopoli, and Feo
battered the city from his rampart, but without much
mischief being done on either side.</p>

<p>On the 29th, the army of the Duke of Milan and the
Bolognese were before the walls of Forlì. A duly
accredited envoy from the Duke entered the town, and
had a long secret interview with Savelli. Communications
passed also between Catherine in the fortress and
her friends outside the city. The fort of Ravaldino
seems during the whole time of the rebellion to have had
free means of communication, for ingress and egress,
with the open country beyond the walls of the city; so
that Catherine might at any time have escaped had she
not preferred to hold the citadel. The preservation of
her dominions, and very possibly her life, were entirely
due to the possession of this stronghold. And the
incidents of this rebellion in Forlì, which may be taken
as a very perfect type of hundreds of similar events of
constant recurrence in the history of the petty principalities
and municipalities of Italy in those centuries,
throw a very sufficient light on the paramount importance
attached by the rulers of those cities to the possession
of such a place of refuge, and the proportionably
vast sums they expended in erecting and
maintaining them. The great difficulty in the matter
always was to find some <i>Castellano</i> sufficiently trustworthy
for it to be safe to confide the fortress to his
keeping. The great power arising from the absolute
command of a building so strong as to be impregnable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
to any means of attack that citizens could bring against
it, and from which the inmates might do much damage
to the city with very little danger of suffering any
injury themselves, was so great and so tempting, that
the governors of these fortresses were rarely to be
depended on. It might be almost said, that in cases
of difficulty and temptation treachery was the rule, and
fidelity to the lord the exception. And it not unfrequently
occurred, that the <i>Castellano</i> within his walls
felt himself to be more than a match for his master and
sovereign outside them: a state of things of which
some of the episodes in the history of Forlì narrated in
these pages have shown us a few symptoms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ORSI ARE OFF.</div>

<p>By the evening of the 29th, it was sufficiently evident
that it was all up with the hopes of the insurgents
in Forlì. The game was clearly played out and lost.
To make their situation still more desperate, a great
number of written papers signed by Catherine were
found scattered about the great square and streets of
the town soon after dusk that evening. These contained
strong exhortations from the Countess to her
faithful subjects of Forlì, to put summarily to death all
the leaders of the conspiracy before they could escape
from the city; and promises of favour and rewards to
any man whose dagger should be the means of making
an end of any one of them.</p>

<p>The Orsi and their associates felt that the city was
rapidly becoming too hot to hold them. That night,
in hurried council, they determined on leaving Forlì
secretly, before morning.</p>

<p>But there was one thing,&mdash;and the incident is strikingly
illustrative of the character of the country and
the epoch, and of the undying ferocity of Italian party
hatred,&mdash;one thing to be done, even before providing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
for their personal safety, fearfully endangered as it
was by every hour of delay. They determined that
Catherine, on coming forth triumphant from her
fortress, should find herself childless; and feel, in the
moment of consummating her success, that it was
worthless to her.</p>

<p>The six children were still at the gate-house in the
care of the three citizens to whom Savelli had entrusted
them. In the early part of the night, therefore,
Checco d'Orso, Ronchi, and Pansecchi presented
themselves at the prison, with a fictitious order from
Savelli that the children should be given up to them
to be conducted to a place of safety out of the city.
Fortunately for the little ones, Capoferri conceived
suspicions of the truth of the representations made to
him, and steadily refused to give up the children,
despite the urgent persuasions and threats of Orsi.
The cautious triumvirate of the gate-house had
declined to admit within their walls more than him
alone of the party at the door. Checco, therefore, on
finding himself thus baffled, made a sign from a
window to his comrades outside to force an entrance
at the moment of his passing out. Ronchi, seizing
an axe, approached the door for this purpose. But a
sentinel on the wall above, observing this hostile
movement, fired down upon him and a servant, who
was with him, and killed the latter. Ronchi retired
from the wall, and at the same moment Orsi came out,
and the gate was safely shut behind him.</p>

<p>There remained nothing for the baulked desperadoes
but to hurry, with rage and despair in their hearts, to
join the small body of relatives and adherents, who
had prepared to quit the city with them. They went
out, a party of seventeen, at two o'clock in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
of the 30th of April: and thus the revolution was
at an end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER ABLE CONDUCT.</div>

<p>According to all medieval law, right, and custom,
Forlì deserved to be sacked in punishment for its
rebellion; and it was not altogether easy for Catherine
to save it from the horrors of such a fate. For it
might be difficult to get rid of the troops who had
come to her aid, if they were baulked of their anticipated
prey. The Countess announced to the citizens
that if she spared them this merited chastisement,
she did so solely for the sake of the women of Forlì;
for the men had not deserved mercy from her: and
eventually, by prudence and caution, and permitting
only a very few of the soldiers to enter the walls,
Forlì was saved from sack.</p>

<p>One of the historians somewhat maliciously observes,
that though he has no doubt of Madama
Caterina's merciful consideration for the women of
Forlì, still it was a fact, that all the vast quantity of
plunder taken from the palace after the murder of the
Count, was scattered through the city, and was subsequently
nearly all recovered by the Countess;
whereas, if Forlì had been sacked, no fragment of all
this wealth would ever have been seen again.</p>

<p>And now, once again, we have pomps and processions,
and complimentary speeches, and smiles, and
oaths of fealty, and gracious condescension. The
magistrates go in procession to Catherine in the
fortress, with the key of the city, and excuses, and
compliments, and loud detestation of the recent crime.
And Catherine, on horseback between the generals of
the forces sent to support her, makes a triumphant
entry into the city; and there is an affecting meeting,
with embracings and tears, between the Countess and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
her children; and Ottaviano is proclaimed Count, and
"Madama," his mother, named regent; poor Girolamo
is buried with much pomp in Imola; every tongue has
something now to tell in favour of the lady regent:&mdash;did
she not, when, surrounded by the Milanese and
Bolognese officers, she was taking formal re-possession
in great state of a fort outside the city, and when a
man-at-arms rushed up to her in the middle of the
ceremony, to say with panting breath, "Madonna! all
the cellars of the Orsi are being plundered by the
people! but I have secured some of the largest butts
of wine for your ladyship, and have set a guard over
them!"&mdash;did she not then and there, in the midst of
the stranger generals, graciously reply, that she preferred
that the poor people should share the wine
among them, for that neither she nor her children
wished to possess anything that had belonged to the
Orsi! ... and, in a word, all is sunshine once again, ... except
in one small cell of the Palazzo Pubblico,
where a few of those who have made themselves
noted by their violence during the insurrection, and
have failed to escape in time from the city, are reserved
for vengeance.</p>

<p>It is but just to Catherine's fair fame to note, that
they were very few; and further to remember, if their
punishment excites our loathing, that mercy was hardly
recognised as a virtue, or known as a sentiment in
those "ages of faith." There were among them the
man who had thrown the Count's body from the
window, and he who had been chiefly prominent in
dragging it through the city. There was also the
veteran revolutionist, Orsi, with his eighty-five years,
long-flowing silver locks, and noble patrician bearing.
The unfortunate old man had been left behind, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
his sons and the others of the family had left the city,
probably because his great age made it impossible for
him to join in their hurried flight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VENGEANCE.</div>

<p>On the 1st of May three of these prisoners were
hung at the windows of the Palazzo Pubblico, and then
thrown thence into the square, where they were literally
torn to pieces, and the shocking fragments left exposed
till sunset, when they were collected and buried. The
brutalising effects of such spectacles on the entire
mass of the population is sufficiently indicated by the
fact, that contemporary public opinion considered the
Countess to have used much and unusual moderation
in her dealings with such of the conspirators as fell
into her hands.</p>

<p>On the evening of that day an ominous decree was
posted in all quarters of the city, requiring that one
able-bodied man from every family in Forlì should
attend on the morrow with pickaxe and crowbar in
front of the vast and magnificent palace of the Orsi.
At daybreak on the 2nd of May a great crowd, armed
as had been ordered, were assembled. At the same
hour the venerable-looking head of the great Orsi clan
was seen coming forth from his prison on the piazza,
bare-headed, with his long silver locks glancing in the
sunshine of that bright May morning, with hands bound
behind his back, and led by the hangman, holding the
end of a halter passed round the old man's neck. Thus
led into the midst of the crowd of his fellow-citizens,
he was placed in front of his ancestral home. And then
the work of demolition was commenced.</p>

<p>"Have you well marked the spectacle, O Orso!"
said the hangman to his prisoner, when the work was
done; and then led him by the halter back to the
piazza.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>A cruel death awaited him there; but that which he
had already endured, was probably the bitterest part
of his punishment to the old patrician. That razing
of the family mansion was infinitely more to a medieval
Italian noble, than the mere destruction of so
much property; and carried with it a bitterness of
misery hardly appreciable to our less clannish feelings,
and less localised attachments. The old Italian noble
would have seen an equal amount of property destroyed
at his villa in the country, or at a residence in a foreign
city, had he possessed such, with comparative indifference.
But the turreted family "palazzo" in his
native city, his fortress in time of civil broil, the
patriarchal home of several branches and generations
of his race, the manifestation and evidence of the
rank and importance of his clan, was more in his eyes
than mere stone and timber. His strongest passion,
his family pride, saw in the old ancestral walls the
corporeal presentment of the family name. And the
levelling of the massive building with the soil, was the
extremest ignominy an enemy could inflict, and was
felt by the doomed race as a symbol of the extinction
of their name and stock for ever.</p>

<p>These were the feelings in that old man's heart,
when the hangman asked if he had well observed the
spectacle before him, as he led him away to the one
other scene that remained for him. In the piazza it
was the nerves of the old man's <i>body</i> that were to be
tortured.</p>

<p>A powerful horse was there ready prepared with a
stout plank attached to its tail. To this plank the
Orso was bound in such a manner that the feet were
nearest to the horse, and the head passing beyond the
length of the board, fell back upon the stones. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
this manner he was dragged twice round the piazza;
and then, though by that time nearly, if not quite
dead, his side was opened, the heart torn from the
quivering carcase, and rent to pieces before the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MORROW AFTER EXECUTION.</div>

<p>But it is probable, that all unpleasant traces of
these things were properly wiped away and removed,
the next morning, when the Countess, in procession,
passed over those same flagstones, on her way to the
cathedral to "celebrate Te Deum," and do other
appropriate "Divine Service."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pbqi">An unprotected Princess.&mdash;Match-making, and its penalties.&mdash;A ladies
man for a Castellano.&mdash;A woman's weakness.&mdash;And a woman's
political economy.&mdash;Wanted, by the city of Forlì, a Jew; any

times in Forlì.&mdash;Alliances made, and broken.&mdash;Catherine once
more a widow.</p>


<p class="pn p2">Our Catherine now found herself in exactly that
position, which in her age and country had led to so
many historical tragedies, and brought about the ruin
of so many similarly situated princesses, and the misery
of the hapless people subjected to them. A beautiful
widow of six-and-twenty, holding one rich principality
in her own right, and a second still more valuable, as
regent for a son only nine years of age, was infallibly a
mark for all the princely fortune-hunters, and ambitious
intriguers throughout Italy. Every degree and mode
of interference from marriage to murder was likely
to be brought to bear by greedy nobles and unprincipled
brother sovereigns against one of the weaker
sex so circumstanced. But Catherine hardly deserves
to be described by such a phrase. If her sex marked
her place among the feebler portion of mankind, the
virility of her character claimed a high standing for
her among the strongest of the masters of creation.
And she felt, and showed herself perfectly capable of
standing alone, and holding her own and her son's
inheritance by her sole unaided prudence and energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">JUST THE THING!</div>

<p>In the early days of her widowhood a report arose
that a marriage<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> was in contemplation between the
Countess of Forlì and Antonio Ordelaffi, pretender to
that principality. His brother, Francesco, was dead,
and he was now the sole representative of the old
dynasty, which had ruled Forlì for so many centuries.
The report of the probability of such a marriage arose,
doubtless, from the manifest advantages derivable from
such an arrangement. It has been seen how sure a
thorn in the sides of the Riarii was the existence of
this exiled but unforgotten family; how insecure and
uneasy it rendered their hold of the principality, and
how the never-ceasing intrigues and incitements of
the pretenders continually kept party jealousies and
hatred alive, and ever and anon burst into insurrectionary
attempts, necessitating constant vigilance and
severe punishments, themselves the cause of further
disaffection.</p>

<p>All this unhappy state of things might be remedied,
the unfortunate heir of a long line of princes restored
to his inheritance, and a beautiful young widow very
satisfactorily mated with a noble and not undistinguished
cavalier (for such Antonio Ordelaffi had
become as a <i>Condottiere</i> in the service of Venice), and
everything made pleasant to all parties by this match.
So thought the gossips, patrician and plebeian, in the
cities of Romagna; and, accordingly, settled the matter
to their own satisfaction, as gossips are wont to do in
similar cases.</p>

<p>So much appearance of authenticity had the report
assumed, and so completely had the good folk of Forlì
taken for granted the truth of it, that in order not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
be found behind-hand in their preparations for the
festivities to ensue, when the great event should be
announced, many families had prepared liveries and
streamers, with the united colours of the Ordelaffi and
Riarii, and staves in great numbers, similarly painted,
for carrying in processions. And it was the chance
discovery of some of these well-intended preparations,
that first revealed to the Countess the plans which her
lieges of Forlì had taken on themselves to make in
her behalf.</p>

<p>Catherine was furious! Who had dared to speak, or
to believe when spoken, so gratuitous and detestable a
calumny? What had the world, and especially her
own subjects, ever seen in her conduct to make them
think it possible that she should sacrifice the prospects
of her son to any considerations of her own tranquillity?
What! she a Sforza, unite herself to an Ordelaffi, and
for fear of him! She need to seek a protector, and
find him in the vagabond heir of a house, whose weakness
and misconduct had deservedly lost them their
dominion! She would show them that her own hand
was strong enough to hold the rein, ay, and the whip
as well, in her City of Forlì. And now, what fool had
been guilty of the insolent absurdity of painting these
sticks with colours so offensively chosen?</p>

<p>Whereupon, cringes into the presence-chamber of
the angry dame, shaking in his shoes, and with many a
profound obeisance, an old acquaintance of our own&mdash;no
other than gossiping Messer Leon Cobelli, musician,
painter, ballet master, and historian! He, in his
capacity of painter, while dreaming of festivals to be
arranged, enjoyed, and afterwards chronicled by himself,
had mingled those tints in so detestable mesalliance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">LEON COBELLI.</div>

<p>Off to the gate-house prison with him, there to
meditate on the difference between scribbling his
history, when his lords had enacted it, and presuming
to arrange it for them beforehand.</p>

<p>So poor Cobelli is forthwith marched off in high
dudgeon, and had awful thoughts,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> in his anger, of condemning
his liege lady to sudden and irreparable
forfeiture of an immortality of glory by burning his
chronicle of her deeds; but the reflection, that in that
case he, Leon Cobelli, ballet-master to the court, would
himself share in the condemnation, happily arrested
his hand before the sacrifice was consummated.</p>

<p>So thoroughly did the high and haughty dame impress
on the frightened Forlìvesi the expediency of holding
their tongues and not opening too wide their eyes in
respect to matters of such delicate nature, and so much
above them, that when, not long afterwards, there
really was somewhat of the sort to talk about, such a
discreet silence was observed, as almost to have
defeated the detective investigations of Mnemosyne
herself.</p>

<p>Tommaso Feo was, as has been seen, governor of
the citadel of Forlì for Catherine, having been placed
there by herself on a very critical occasion. It has
been seen, also, how well and zealously he acquitted
himself of his trust in the difficult circumstances following
upon the assassination of the Count. He came
from Savona, Girolamo's birthplace, and had been for
many years a faithful follower of the fortunes of the
Riarii. Now, this Tommaso Feo had a brother,
Giacomo, not yet twenty years old, a remarkably handsome
youth, "very tall, excellently well-made, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
beautiful pink complexion, courteous and pleasant with
all, both high and low, and well skilled in all manly
and knightly exercises."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> This well-favoured youth had
been looked on with a very approving eye by the high
and puissant dame, his sovereign lady. And the circumstance
of her having, a short time previously, given
a lady, who was a relative of her own, in marriage to
Tommaso Feo, his brother, made it seem natural that
both the young men should be admitted more freely
into the society of the Countess than might otherwise
have been expected.</p>

<p>Before long, however, the young and beautiful widow
determined on taking a step, which,&mdash;as is frequently
the case with the steps taken by young and beautiful
widows,&mdash;caused no little raising of the eyebrows, and
some very cautiously whispered talk among the citizens
of Forlì. This was nothing less startling than the
substitution of the young and handsome bachelor
brother, for the tried and trusty elder brother, in
the high and important post of <i>Castellano</i> of Ravaldino.</p>

<p>But high-handed and strong as Catherine was, we
have already seen enough of the ways of these
governors of strong fortresses in general, and of stout
Tommaso Feo in particular, to make it very intelligible
that the lady did not see fit to proceed to her intent by
simply ordering Tommaso to walk out, and Giacomo to
walk in to Ravaldino. A good <i>Castellano's</i> duty was to
hold his castle, as a good terrier's duty is to hold the
throat of the creature he has been bidden to attack;
and it often happens that the master of the staunch
beast cannot induce him to relinquish his gripe. The
question was, before a word had transpired of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
proposed change, how to get staunch Tommaso out
of his place of strength.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CASTELLANO LURED OUT.</div>

<p>With this view, the crafty lady gave a fête in her
gardens outside the city, to which the Governor was
courteously invited. In this little excursion outside
the walls, there was little to excite the <i>Castellano's</i>
suspicions. He could leave the communication
between the fortress and the city safely closed behind
him, come out from the citadel into the open country,
and return to it at pleasure by the same road. But what
is man's wit worth against a woman's wiles! In the
gardens, no arm would serve Catherine to lean on save
that of her trusty <i>Castellano</i>. They spent a charming
day; "tasted together various fruits;" and when his
beautiful sovereign declared herself at the end of the
day's pleasure so tired that he must give her his arm
as far as the palace, what mortal <i>Castellano</i> could do
otherwise than fall into the trap so cleverly baited.</p>

<p>If such there were, good Tommaso Feo was not the
man. Pleased and flattered, he led the fair traitress
through the little city to her palace, and was no sooner
within its walls than he was tapped on his shoulder,
and bade to deliver up his sword, and consider himself
a prisoner! This having been satisfactorily done,
Madama,&mdash;as the chroniclers from the period of her
first husband's death almost invariably call her,&mdash;summoned
the conscious Giacomo to her presence,
and stated, that though nothing had occurred to diminish
her high esteem for his brother, circumstances
made it desirable that she should change her <i>Castellano</i>&mdash;that
Tommaso would for the present return to his
native Savona, quitting the city with a guard of honour
as a mark of her high consideration; and that she
wished him to accept the vacated post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>Giacomo, we are told, accepted his preferment with
well-acted modesty and surprise, and Tommaso appears
to have become easily reconciled to the arrangement,
as he is not long after found back again in Forlì, in the
service of the Countess.</p>

<p>These events took place in the summer of 1490;
and there is reason<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> to suppose that the new <i>Castellano</i>
had then been his liege lady's husband for several
months. The marriage, though a perfectly legitimate
one in the eyes of the Church, was, and remained a
rigidly guarded secret; not only because it was a
wholly unavowable mesalliance, but because according
the public law of the Holy Roman Empire, Catherine's
second marriage would have entailed deprivation of the
guardianship of her children.</p>

<p>It was, as may be supposed, by no means a prudent
thing even to allude to a secret of such importance.
A poor ignorant artisan, who had been overheard
saying, that somebody had told him, that somebody
else had said that their lady had married her <i>Castellano</i>,
was forthwith summoned to the presence of the
Countess, who, after a few words spoken with a severity
which half frightened him out of his senses, ordered
him at once to be put on the rack: from which torture,
says the historian, he barely escaped with his life.
We may be very sure, that few words were ever
whispered even in Forlì on so dangerous a subject.
And the reverend biographer, who relates the above
incident, seems as if he hardly felt safe two hundred
years afterwards in meddling with such state secrets,
remarking apologetically, that he merely notifies the
fact, that his readers may not think any ill when they
at a later period meet with mention of a son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Catherine's named Giacomo, born somewhere about
this time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FORTUNATE YOUTH.</div>

<p>In truth, the Forlì public had little cause to pay any
attention to this portion of the private life of their
sovereign. For in all respects as far as regarded them,
and as far as the world could see, Catherine was still
sovereign Countess, and Giacomo Feo still <i>Castellano</i>
of Ravaldino, and nothing more. All that could be
done for her young husband without lifting him from
the rank of a subject, Catherine delighted in accomplishing.
Thus, we find her obtaining for him from
her brother at Milan some order of chivalry, all the
insignia of which were duly sent by the hands of
proper heraldic personages from that splendid court.
The noblest knights of the most conspicuous families
in Forlì invested the young man, one with cloak,
another with collar, and another with spurs; and there
were grand festivities, and Catherine was, it is written,
in the highest spirits.</p>

<p>Her new marriage, we are especially told, in no wise
made her neglectful of her duties towards her children,
and especially that of constantly attending to their
education, and superintending it in a great measure
personally. She took infinite pains in seeking for the
best masters, and in ascertaining for what career each
of her sons was by nature most adapted. We learn
further, without surprise, that she was a careful and
prudent, rather than an indulgent mother; and find
her acquiring the praise of contemporary writers by
"never caressing her children," and never allowing
them to come into her presence, save in full state
costume, and requiring them to maintain a grave and
decorous demeanor to match!<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>
<p>For the rest, public affairs go on much the same as
during the lifetime of Girolamo. The conspiracies are
hatched and detected much as usual. That troublesome
Ordelaffi knows no middle course between love
and murder. As Catherine would not listen to him on
the former topic, he is continually plotting to compass
the latter. Now in Imola, now in Forlì, and now in
some one of the outlying fortresses of the small state,
some little conspiracy is continually being discovered
and crushed by the lady's prudence and vigilance. A
few traitors, found guilty of being in correspondence
with the pretender, are hung, a few others banished,&mdash;and
then things are quiet for a few months.</p>

<p>As usual, the finance question is found to be the
most difficult and abstruse part of the whole science of
governing. The court of Forlì is maintained, we
hear, on as magnificent a scale as that of many larger
states. And money must be had. But Madama is a
good manager; and strives much to find some means
of making a full treasury not absolutely incompatible
with a fair show of prosperity among the tax-payers;
not, unhappily, with much success.</p>

<p>Once Madama thought she had found the Aladdin's
lamp at last. The great Via Emilia, high road from
Milan, Bologna, Venice, and all Germany, to Rome,
runs through our towns of Imola and Forlì. Suppose
we put up, as we have a clear right to do, a turnpike-gate,&mdash;say
two toll-bars,&mdash;one at either end of our
territory, and so fleece travellers to the most needful
replenishing of our own coffers, and every way desirable
lightening of the burdens of our faithful subjects.
How strange never to have thought of it before!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW TOLL-BARS.</div>

<p>So the new toll-bars are forthwith erected; but to
the great surprise of Madama and her counsellors with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
very much less result than had been anticipated; with
little other result indeed than a few broken heads and
bloody noses, arising from the scuffles of the toll-bar
keepers with violent travellers who decline paying the
new imposition. This was all natural enough; but the
strange thing is, that the traffic most notably falls off.
Travellers won't come to be taxed. Ducky won't come
to be killed. With a perverse cunning, most provoking,
men go round another way; some stay at home and
don't go at all; and the toll-bars barely pay the
expense of their keepers. Then the Pesaro folk,
whose communications with the neighbouring towns
are much interrupted by the Lady Catherine's new
toll-bars, take it into their heads to retaliate, by seizing
every Forlì man who ventures to show his face within
their jurisdiction, weighing him publicly on a steel
yard by the road-side, and taxing him so much a pound,
as if he were hogsflesh or mutton, to the great amusement
and scoffing of the cities round about, and the
infinite scandal and discomfiture of the men of Forlì.</p>

<p>But Catherine was a wise princess, and in a very
short time got a lesson in finance from her new scheme,
which some other princes have failed to learn from the
experience of centuries; and the unsuccessful toll-bars
were quietly removed.</p>

<p>Another somewhat curious matter, in which we find
Madama engaged about this time, was the providing
Forlì, both on her own behalf and that of her subjects,
with one of the most necessary conveniences of civilised
life, of which the city had been destitute since the riots
at the time of the Count's death. The banks and pawnshops
of two wealthy Jews had been then broken into
and pillaged, and their owners frightened into abandoning
the city. And now if a Christian had need of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
a little ready cash, where was he to look for it? Money
absolutely needed, and not a Jew within hail! Madama
felt that this was a state of things calling for immediate
remedy. So special overtures were made to a wealthy
Israelite of Bologna to come and settle in Forlì. The
Jew admitted the urgent necessity of the case, but
bearing in mind recent events, deemed it no more than
common prudence to stipulate, that an instrument
should be drawn up and executed in due legal form, by
which the sovereign, state, and municipality, of Forlì,
should be bound to indemnify him for any loss to his
capital or property that might occur from revolution or
other violence. This was promptly acceded to; the
Jew was installed in Forlì, to the great joy of its ever-orthodox,
but often out-at-elbows, Christian population;
and, by Madama's wise provision, her lieges
could once again get their little bills done as heretofore.</p>

<p>Meantime, Innocent VIII. died; and in August of
the same year, 1492, the Sacred College announced
"<i>Urbi et Orbi</i>" that they had been inspired by the
Holy Spirit to elect as Heaven's Vicegerent on earth,
the Cardinal Roderigo Borgia; one, who may be safely
assumed, without any careful scanning of the members
of the college, to have been the worst of those offered
to their choice, inasmuch as history has assigned to
him the portentous pre-eminence of being the worst of
the successors of St. Peter. English readers have no
idea what this Pope, Alexander VI., was; and no
English page can dare to tell them. Studious men,
who feel, that, inasmuch as despite all change of time
and circumstance, similar causes will, in the moral
world as certainly as in the physical world, produce
similar effects, it is therefore fitting that such cesspools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
of abominations should be sounded by those
who for the sake of the general health ought to be
conversant with every form of disease,&mdash;these may in
the cynical unblushing dead Latin of Burckhardt the
diarist, look on the loathsome picture of life in the
Vatican under this Father of Christendom. For others
let it suffice, that this man, chosen by the Church by
infallible inspiration, for the infallible guidance of
Christian souls, was such, that no human soul could be
in communication with his without deep injury and
degradation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALEXANDER VI.</div>

<p>This man, as Cardinal under Sixtus IV., had been
his vice-chancellor, and a steady adherent of the
Riarii. He was the sponsor chosen by the young
Count and Countess to hold at the font their first-born
son. And the friendship which existed, and was thus
specially marked, between them and such a man as the
Cardinal Borgia, cannot but be felt to have the force of
unfavourable evidence in our estimate of them.</p>

<p>Catherine, however, considered the news of Borgia's
elevation to be most important to her interests, and
highly satisfactory. Two envoys on behalf of Forlì,
and two on behalf of Imola, were despatched to Rome
to compliment the new Pope on his election, and offer
the homage of the Countess and her son. Being very
well received by his Holiness, they begged that he
would grant that a Jubilee, with plenary absolution,
might be held for three successive years in two
churches of the Franciscans in Forlì, which was
graciously accorded, with the condition however that
a fresh bull should be applied for each year; which
was only laying a small tax on the profits of the
Jubilee. Such a grant was not uncommon. But the
result of the three years' speculation, as recorded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the Forlì historians, is curious. The first year brought
2500 lire, with which the monks of one church built a
cloister, and the nuns of the other put a new roof to
their chapel, and newly fitted out a miraculous Virgin.
The second year's produce was almost nothing, because
the brief enabling the convents to absolve from homicide
did not arrive in time. And the third year, they got
only 184 lire, because the Apostolic Court, having
then more important matters in hand, again neglected
to send the necessary brief in due time.</p>

<p>Up to this period the life of Catherine has been
passed altogether in that good time,&mdash;those halcyon
days for Italy described by Guicciardini in the opening
of his great work, and marked by him as coming to an
end in the fatal year, 1494. To readers more conversant
with the regular well-ordered course of life in
the nineteenth century than with that of the fifteenth,
it may seem, that the little magic-lanthorn-like peeps
at the men and things of that old time, offered to
them in the foregoing pages, can hardly be deemed
samples of that happy condition so regretfully commemorated
by the great historian. Murders of princes,
and awards of torture and death to their conspiring
subjects, recurring in oscillations of pendulum-like
regularity,&mdash;civil war in the streets of Rome, and monstrous
corruption in her palaces,&mdash;lawless violence of
the law-making classes, met by continually successful
evasion of the law by those for whose oppression
rather than protection it was intended: all this does
not represent to our ideas a happy state of society.</p>

<p>But Guicciardini looks back to these days from amid
the misfortunes of a far more disastrous period. The
good old days,&mdash;when Italian throats were throttled only
by Italian hands; when the tyrants were Italian tyrants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
not too strong to be occasionally knocked on the head
by Italian rebels; when the wealth extorted from the
people by splendid princes was at least scattered among
them again by their splendour; when, in a word, Italy,
manage it as they might, was for the Italians,&mdash;were
sighed for as a golden age in that iron period, when the
barbarian from beyond the Alps had come down upon
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNPLEASANT POSITION.</div>

<p>Charles VIII., of France, was the second Attila,
who headed an inroad of barbarians, from whose gripe
on some part of her body, soft Italy has never since
been able to shake herself free. That ambitious
Prince undertook to make good certain old standing
genealogical claims to the sovereignty of Naples, long
since advanced by France; and marched into Italy with
an army for that purpose in the summer of 1494. It
would lead us too far away into the great high-road of
the history of that time, if we were to attempt to trace
an intelligible picture of the dissensions and jealousies
among the princes of Italy, which made that moment
appear peculiarly opportune for the prosecution of
his claims. We have only to deal with the immediate
result of the great calamity to Forlì and its Countess.</p>

<p>Those rich alluvial flats of Romagna were capital
fighting ground, and lay besides just on the high road
of the French troops southwards. And on the 18th of
August the main body of the Neapolitan troops were at
Cesena, about twelve miles to the south; and five days
later the French troops were at Bologna, some thirty
miles to the north of Forlì. The little state found
itself in a sufficiently dangerous position under any
circumstances. But the situation was rendered yet
more difficult by the necessity of taking one or the
other side, when there were strong reasons for taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
neither. The Duke of Milan, Catherine's brother,
and her uncle "Ludovico il Moro," who, in fact, held
the power of Milan in his hands, were allies of the
French king. On the other hand, the Pope had allied
himself with the King of Naples; and Forlì was held
as a fief of the Church; and all Catherine's sympathies,
and her Riario connections,&mdash;among whom were two
cardinals high in the confidence of the Pontiff,&mdash;drew
her towards the party taken by the court of Rome.</p>

<p>The decision was difficult; and Catherine was long
in deciding. Repeated embassies were seen in those
days arriving from the hostile camps, and departing
without having obtained the promise they wished.</p>

<p>Meantime, Madama was busily engaged in preparing,
as best she might, for the storm which was sure to
burst over Forlì, whichever side she might decide on
supporting. Men were sent throughout the whole
territory warning the peasants of the plains to leave
their homes, and betake themselves<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> with such property
as was moveable to places of safety. The time
of vintage was close at hand, and it was hard to leave
the fruit of the year's labour to be gathered by others.
But to have remained would only have been to lose all
that might have been moved, and probably life itself,
as well as that which they were compelled to leave
behind them. So, throughout the length and breadth
of the plains around Forlì, long trains of the cultivators
of the soil, with their families and cattle, might be
seen moving into the shelter of the over-crowded cities,
or towards the comparatively safe recesses of the
Apennine.</p>

<p>At length, after much vacillation and long bargaining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Madama declared herself the ally of the King of
Naples. The principal conditions were, that both
Naples and Rome should guarantee the defence of her
states; and that Octavian, her eldest son, then seventeen
years old, should receive the rank of General in
the allied army with a large stipend.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">IMPORTANCE OF HER FRIENDSHIP.</div>

<p>The historians of Forlì, and especially Burriel,
Catherine's biographer, insist much on the pause in
the movements of the two armies, while encamped
respectively at Bologna and at Cesena, while either
party strove by repeated efforts to obtain her alliance.
It would not be credible, Burriel remarks, that the
generals of two armies, each of about 16,000 men,
should have lost so much time, and taken so much
trouble to secure the friendship of so small a principality,
if all the chroniclers did not accord in their
clear statements, that such was the case. And they
point out, with much municipal pride, the high position
and authority which these circumstances indicate
Catherine to have attained among her contemporaries.
The observation is a fair one. And the evident importance
attached by both the contending parties to the
friendship of a state so entirely unimportant on the
score of its power, is very remarkable.</p>

<p>The alliance with Naples, which Madama had been
so slow to form, she was very quick to break. A few
successes on the part of the French seem to have
caused a greater degree of discouragement among their
enemies than was reasonable. The Pope recalled his
troops from Romagna, and the Duke of Calabria began
to draw off his forces southwards. In these circumstances,
which would seem to have left Forlì exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
to certain destruction, and to have been totally at
variance with the conditions that had been stipulated
for its protection, Catherine sought to secure the
safety of her little state by suddenly changing sides
and becoming at the shortest possible notice the friend
of the winning party. The measure was not wholly
successful: for the Duke of Calabria in retiring southwards,
angry as he might well be with the Countess,
ravaged the country as he passed to the utmost of
his power.</p>

<p>The French troops remained in the neighbourhood
of Forlì as friends till the 23rd of November, at which
time they proceeded to cross the Apennine to join
King Charles, who had arrived at Florence on the 18th
of that month. They were friends, but friends whose
departure was seen with no small satisfaction; for the
difficulty and cost of feeding them, and inducing them
to abstain from helping themselves had been extreme.</p>

<p>During this time of trouble and continual anxiety,
Giacomo Feo had been governor-general of Catherine's
states. He seems to have efficiently seconded the
dexterous management, by which Catherine succeeded
in bringing her little state through this critical time in
an only half-ruined condition; and Madama, determined,
says Burriel, not to let such an opportunity as
having these French generals at Forlì slip away without
making something out of it, obtained by their
means the rank and title of baron for her General and
husband from the King of France.</p>

<p>The young General was, we are told, beyond
measure elated at the possession of this coveted preferment;
and Madama was as pleased to have gratified
him with it. But, it would seem, that the gift was a
fatal one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MURDER OF FEO.</div>

<p>On the 27th of August, 1495, Catherine and her
sons and Feo had gone out of Forlì on a hunting
excursion. The party were returning to the city in
the evening; Madama, and some of her sons, were in
a carriage, Feo was riding behind them on horseback.
Now, seven<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> citizens of Imola and Forlì, some nobles,
some priests, and some peasants, had sworn together
that they would that day kill the favourite. So they
posted themselves at a spot within the city walls, by
which the Court party were sure to pass on their
return; and there, letting the carriage with Catherine
and her sons pass on unmolested, they stabbed the
unfortunate young husband with a pike through the
body, so that with one cry he fell dead.</p>

<p>It is of no interest to chronicle the obscure names of
these assassins. But it is worth remarking that most,
if not all of them, were personally known to their
victim. And this is a circumstance, that in almost
every case characterises these medieval assassinations
of Italian princes. The murderers are not politically
fanatical regicides, who for the working out of some
theory or hope, salve their consciences with the plea of
necessity for the removal of a man whom they have
perhaps never seen, and certainly never known. They
are men in the habit of daily intercourse with him,
and strike with all the virulence of personal hate.
The victim apostrophises them by their Christian
names, not unconscious in all probability of the items
in the score thus finally settled.</p>

<p>In the case of this unfortunate young Feo, as far as
can be judged<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> from the scanty notices of the provincial
historians, his death seems to have been due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the jealousy occasioned by the reiterated honours
showered upon him. This obscure young man, a
stranger from Savona, some place, they say, away
beyond Genoa, is brought here, raised above all the
ancient nobility of the country, made Cavaliere, Conte,
Castellano, Governor-General; and now not content
with all that, must needs be a French Baron too!
This last preferment seems from some feeling to have
been the most irksome and most odious of all to the
Forlìvesi. Come what might, they would not be lorded
over by a French Baron!</p>

<p>And thus, at the age of thirty-three, Catherine was
for the second time after five years of marriage, the
widow of a murdered husband.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Catherine, with two of her sons in the carriage
with her, had advanced but a few yards beyond the
spot where the murder was committed, when, alarmed
by the cries of the conspirators and of her own retinue,
she looked back, and became at once aware of the
truth. The whole of the attendants, except two, who
made a futile attempt to kill or arrest the assassins,
immediately dispersed themselves, and fled in different
directions. The seven conspirators did likewise; and
Catherine and her sons, hastily throwing themselves on
horses taken from the grooms, galloped at full speed to
the fortress. And the murdered man's body was left
alone in a ditch near the spot where he was slain, till
late that night it was removed to a neighbouring
church by "some decent and compassionate people"
who lived hard by. The ballet-master historian<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
Cobelli went to look on it, as it lay in the ditch, and
pours forth a flood of voluble lamentations over the
beauty of the body thus mutilated and disfigured, and
that of his gold brocade jacket and rose-coloured pantaloons
besmeared with mud.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Necessity for providing for their own safety may
furnish some excuse for Catherine and her sons' precipitate
retreat to the citadel. Her husband was
beyond all need of assistance, and her sons' security,
and that of her dominions, was in imminent danger.
For it was probable enough, that the assassination just
committed almost under her eyes was the first outbreak
of one of those plans for restoring the old dynasty
that were so constantly occurring.</p>

<p>Such, however, does not seem to have been the case.
The popular indignation against the perpetrators of
Feo's murder was at once strongly manifested. They
were that night hunted through the town, and most of
them dragged prisoners to the piazza before the
morning.</p>

<p>There, before the assembled crowd, Gian Antonio
Ghetti, the principal of them, declared to the magistrates
that Feo had been put to death by the express
order of Catherine and Octavian; and the others
loudly confirmed his assertion.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> There does not seem
to have been the slightest attempt made to test the
truth of these declarations by separately examining
and cross-questioning the assassins. But it is remarkable,
that the <i>Auditor</i>, Catherine's chief magistrate,
does not appear to have considered this explanation at
all impossible. On the contrary, he found himself in a
position of difficulty, evidently fearing, that if he proceeded
at once on the supposition, that these men were
to be treated as murderers and traitors, his zeal might
possibly turn out to have been expended on the wrong
side. In this difficulty "the worthy magistrate" beckoned
from the crowd a young man whom he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
trust, and with a few whispered words despatched him
in all haste to the fortress, dexterously holding law in
leash the while.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WAS CATHERINE GUILTY?</div>

<p>In a very short time the messenger returned, and
our "worthy magistrate" was himself again. It was
all right. Murther was murther. Law was to "have
its course;" and quartering alive, dragging at horses
tails, and other ingenious devices of the sort were
to be resorted to, according to the most approved
precedents.</p>

<p>But are these orders from the citadel as efficacious
in disproving the truth of Gian Antonio's assertion
before the tribunal of history, as they were in making
the Auditor's course clear before him? The learned
Litta, in his great work on the Families of Italy thinks
not. He writes,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> "Feo was killed by conspirators in
1495: if, indeed, it were not Catherine herself who
ordered his death." But we know that suspicion of
crime becomes morbidly active in those whose duties
make them continually conversant with criminals; and
in estimating the value of Litta's impressions, great
allowance must be made for the mental bias of one
who spent his life in chronicling the Fasti of the noble
families of Italy.</p>

<p>No contemporary writer gives the slightest indication
of any suspicion of the possible truth of this
audacious inculpation of the widowed princess having
existed at the time. It is true, that if such suspicions
had existed, they would probably have been deep
buried in the hearts of those who conceived them. But
all the probabilities of the case plead in favour of
Catherine's innocence upon this occasion. Had she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
wished to rid herself of her young husband, nothing
would have been easier than to have made an end of
him, privately, quietly, and safely, in the secresy of the
fort or of the palace. It is curious to observe, that
when subsequently she condescended to point out the
absurdity of the accusation, she made use of this argument;
remarking, as the historian records it, that
"Thank God, neither she nor any of her family had
need to apply to common bravoes, when they saw fit to
make away with their enemies!" Had she even
chosen to employ bravoes for the purpose, with the
intention of leaving to them the responsibility of the
deed, it might have been done far more safely in the
palace than in the street. The latter necessarily involved
a very considerable degree of danger of popular
tumult, and ever-menacing, ever-near revolution. In
the confusion and excitement following the perpetration
of such a deed, it may be said to have been merely
a toss up which way the popular mind, so easily moved
to violence, so prone to change, might turn.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, no more curiously suggestive and
striking proof of the chronic state of discontent,
uneasiness, and discomfort, in which men lived in
those good old times, than this wonderful readiness
to turn any incident of sufficient interest to make a
couple of score of tongues shout together, into an
occasion for seeking to change for another the rider
mounted on their galled shoulders, at whatsoever
almost certain cost of ruin and destruction to them
and theirs.</p>

<p>Them and theirs;&mdash;for another very noticeable trait
of Italian social life in those centuries is the great
strength of the clannish tie, which made all the members
of a family responsible for, and generally partakers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
the political crimes of any one among them. The
fathers, sons, brothers, uncles of a baffled, detected, or
overpowered conspirator, share his fate. Often the
females of a family are involved in the condemnation.
The whole race is to be rooted out. And such an
award seems to have been generally accepted as natural,
and to be expected, at least, if not as just, by the
suffering party. In most cases the members of a
political assassin's family adopted his views, and more
or less actively shared his crime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VENGEANCE.</div>

<p>In the present instance, the vengeance of the bereaved
wife took a yet wider sweep. Not only were the families
of the guilty men, even women and innocent children
and infants at the breast, slaughtered indiscriminately;
but the slightest cause of suspicion sufficed to involve
others wholly unconnected with them in destruction.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
This seems to have been the only occasion in the
strangely varied life of Catherine, when evil passions,
unmixed with political reasons, or calculations of
expediency, governed her conduct, and urged her to
excesses of cruelty. And it is impossible to avoid
comparing the calm, judicial proceedings, and not
wholly unreasonable chastisement, consequent upon
the death of Riario, with the wild excesses of vindictive
fury that followed that of Giacomo Feo.
Surely it cannot be supposed that all this was simulated
rage, acted out in such terrible earnest, merely to
divert suspicion from herself as the murderess! Not
even acquaintance with the unnatural atrocities so
common in that age and clime, nor the wonderful
deadness of the moral sense which prevailed, can justify
so shocking a belief.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>
<p>No! Either we must suppose, that passing years,
the habits of despotism, familiarity with bloodshed, and
much trouble and adversity had potently changed
Catherine's character for the worse. Or we must,
with perhaps more probability, seek an explanation of
her altered conduct in the difference of the feelings the
two bereavements may be supposed to have occasioned.
In the first case, we have a princess decorously mourning;
and with high stern justice punishing the political
fanatics, who had taken from her a husband, the partner
indeed of her greatness, and fellow-labourer in the toils
of ambition; but one, who had been assigned to her
solely for the purposes of that ambition, and whom no
preference or personal sympathy had had any share in
selecting. In the second instance, we have a woman,
raging with tiger-like fury against the murderers of her
love. This so faultlessly beautiful form, ruthlessly
made a mangled corpse before her eyes, was the first
and last love of this vehement and strong-willed
woman;&mdash;her only taste of real natural heart's joy;&mdash;the
one pet, private sanctuary of her life, not dedicated
to the weary life-long toil of building up the Riario
name. Hence the almost indiscriminate slaughter,
hanging, quartering, torturing, banishments, and ruin,
that scared all Forlì with fear who next might be the
victim, when Giacomo Feo fell. Above forty persons,
counting men, women, and children, were put to death,
of whom the greater part were in all probability wholly
innocent of any participation in the crime! More than
fifty others suffered lesser degrees of persecution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FUNERAL.</div>

<p>In the midst of these horrors, while the mutilated
bodies of some of the victims were still hanging before
the palace of the <i>Podestà</i>, exposed to the public view,
a most magnificent funeral ceremony was performed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
honour of the murdered Feo. Burriel describes the
long line of ecclesiastical, military, and civic dignitaries,
with pages, musicians, ladies, friars, soldiers, and three
squires in cloth of gold, on horses similarly caparisoned,
who bore the sword, spurs, helmet, and cuirass of the
deceased, moving to the sound of loud-chanted dirges
from the fortress to the cathedral. The procession
must have passed with its wailing <i>De profundis</i> and
<i>Miserere</i> chants, and its glittering heraldic braveries,
by the spot where the ghastly remains of the victims,
for whom was no "miserere," were polluting the air
in the hot summer sunshine. And the entire scene in
its setting of picturesque Italian city architecture, with
its startling contrasts, and suggestiveness of unbridled
passions, and deeds of lawless violence, would seem to
be marked characteristically enough by the impress
of medieval peculiarities. But Burriel says, that the
similitude of the spectacle to that described by Virgil,
as having taken place at the funeral of Pallas, son of
King Evander, was so great, that it may be supposed
that Catherine had modelled the one in imitation of
the other!</p>

<p>By the combined soothing of funeral services, and
gratified vengeance, the bereaved widow was, it should
seem, sufficiently consoled, to engage herself, early in
the year 1496, in extensive projects of palace building,
and acquisition of parks and pleasure-grounds. The
alterations and improvements, which Madama was now
bent on, mark characteristically the change in the
habits and desires of the powerful and wealthy, which
was now beginning to manifest itself. Increasing
magnificence and luxury demanded ampler opportunity
for its display, and a pleasanter field for its
enjoyment. Italian princes began to be no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
content to pass their lives immured in the high
dungeon-like walls of ancient feudal mansions, in the
heart of walled and gloomy cities.</p>

<p>And Catherine was not likely to be among the
slowest to adopt any new mode of increased magnificence
and splendour. There were, moreover, dark
and sad reminiscences enough attached to the old
seignorial residence in the <i>piazza</i>, to make it odious
to the lady twice widowed there, under circumstances
in themselves, and in their consequences, so painful to
look back on.</p>

<p>So all that portion of the ancient building, which
had been used for the personal accommodation of the
Princess, was thrown down; and its materials contributed
towards the erection of a new palace, at the
extremity of the city, near to the fortress Ravaldino,
and connected with it by one of the gateways of the
town. The pleasures and splendour, which the tastes
of the new age demanded, were thus admirably made
compatible with the old time provision for security,
which could by no means yet be dispensed with. For
material was advancing more rapidly than moral
civilisation.</p>

<p>Outside the wall, in connection with the new palace,
a large tract of land was purchased<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> for orchards,
gardens, dairy pastures, "a great wood, in which were
wild beasts of various kinds for the lord's diversion of
hunting," and every kind of device, by which the
inmates "might at all hours enjoy the pleasures of
the country unobserved." The place was, "from its
magnificence and beauty, named the Paradise;"<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and
in all the preparations for making her Paradise perfect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Catherine "left nothing unattempted, which could be
a proof of greatness and of a royal mind."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COST OF PARADISE.</div>

<p>But there is a vile, ignoble difficulty, that ever dogs
and hampers this sort of proof of a great and royal
mind. Paradises are not produced in iron, brazen, or
leaden ages, without abundant supply of cash. Royal
minds have, accordingly, been ever exceedingly apt
to show their quality by a remarkable fertility of
expedient for the procuring of this base means for
great aims. And Burriel details for us, with much
admiration, the method hit upon by Catherine for
paying for her new palace and park.</p>

<p>There were, it seems, and for generations had been,
certain taxes, to which lands in the territory of Forlì
possessed by peasants were liable, and which were not
paid by such as were in the hands of citizens. The
unjust difference, it is to be remarked, does not appear
to have been made between patrician and plebeian as
such, but between countryman and townsman. The
possessors of these unequally-taxed lands were, as
might be supposed, an impoverished class, continually
sinking towards utter destitution, and numbers of the
peasant proprietors sold their land to prosperous
citizens "for a bit of bread," says the historian, thus
baulking the tax-gatherer and depopulating the country.
As it was necessary to find a remedy for this growing
evil, and as the simple one of equalising the tax was an
idea far too opposed to the whole fabric of medieval
political economy to enter for a moment even into the
head of anyone, it was enacted, that no peasant should
sell his land under heavy penalties, and forfeiture of
the land by the buyer.</p>

<p>Now this wise law, as is usually the case with such,
was very frequently evaded by the connivance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
parties anxious, the one to sell and the other to buy,
and it was found extremely difficult to bring the illegality
home to offenders. But it so happened, that
just at the time of Catherine's greatest need, the "Bargello"
or gaol-governor of Imola was himself committed
to prison for the non-payment of a fine of 200
ducats imposed on him for some mal-practices in his
office. It seems, however, that besides the delinquencies
for which he had been condemned, he had
been in the habit of lending some official facilities to
the illegal bargains for land between peasants and
townsmen. Reflecting, therefore, on his own position
and that of his sovereign lady, it struck this shrewd
and worthy "Bargello," that he might find the means
of making his undetected offences pay the penalty for
those which had been discovered. So he caused
a communication to be made to Madama to the
effect, that if his liberty were granted him, and pardon
assured to him for anything in respect to which
he might perchance compromise himself, in certain
revelations he proposed making to her, he thought
he could put her in a way to find the necessary funds
for her new palace and park, without doing wrong to
anyone.</p>

<p>This latter clause was a <i>sine quâ non</i> with Catherine
of course; but on the understanding that that condition
was to be faithfully observed, she closed with her
"Bargello's" offer at once. So that useful and clever
officer came up to Forlì from his prison in Imola with
a long list, all duly prepared, of all the illegal land-sales
for a long time past. Twenty-five lire was the
fine due from each seller, and total forfeiture of the
purchased lands the much heavier penalty to be levied
on each buyer. Intense was the consternation throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Forlì and its county! And rich and abundant
the harvest reaped by the sovereign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAXES TO SPEND IN ALMS.</div>

<p>So our good "Bargello" is liberated and graciously
pardoned. No wrong is done to anybody, since, on
the contrary, law is enforced, and right therefore done.
"Paradise" is won, and duly paid for, and remains, as
the historian Bonoli so judiciously remarks, a proof of
the royal-mindedness of its noble builder.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that the unequal pressure of
this land-tax had caused a vast amount of pauperism
and destitution; and the presence of pestilence in
Forlì and its territory both this year and the last,
following in the wake of an army of foreign troops, as
has so often happened, had terribly increased the evil.
This and other oppressive taxes were, therefore, more
necessary than ever, for Catherine (besides the cost of
her improvements, so happily paid for out of nothing
at all, as one may say,) was at great expenses for the
alleviation of the increasing misery. She bought corn,
she organised means of relief, she hired medical men
from foreign parts, she founded confraternities for
charitable purposes, but she repealed no taxes. How
could she with such imperative calls on her for alms?</p>

<p>Can it be that splendid princes find it more congenial
to royal-minded tastes, and more convenient to
royal-minded habits, to reign over alms-fed mendicants
than over prosperous self-fed freemen? Then again,
what says Mother Church? Is not almsgiving the
broadest of all the roads to heaven? And how are the
rich to, buy off their own sins in conformity with
orthodox rule, if there are no beggars?</p>

<p>But among all the cares and occupations arising out
of the twofold business of advancing her own splendour
and alleviating the misery of her subjects, Catherine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
found time to think of yet another matter of still
greater importance than either of these. Madama was
now meditating a third marriage, and this time she
seems to have returned to the plan of marrying from
policy and ambition. Probably the increasing storminess
of the political horizon, and the consequent precariousness
of the position of all the smaller princes of
Italy, made her deem it desirable to seek the support
which a connexion with some important and powerful
family would afford her. In truth, it was the eve of a
period, during which it was hardly to be expected that
any unaided female hand, however virile in its energy,
would be able to retain its grasp of a sceptre; and
considering the matter in this point of view, she
could not, probably, have chosen more prudently than
she did.</p>

<p>For the last year past, Giovanni de' Medici had been
residing in Forlì as Ambassador from the Republic of
Florence. He was great-grandson of that Giovanni
who was the common ancestor of the two great
branches of the family. That founder of the Medicean
greatness had two sons, the elder of whom was Cosmo,
"pater patriæ," from whom descended the elder
branch, including among its scions Lorenzo the Magnificent,
the two Popes Leo X. and Clement VII., and
Catherine, the wife of Henry II. of France, and
becoming extinct in the person of Alexander first Duke
of Florence, murdered in 1537. Giovanni's second
son, the younger brother of Cosmo, was Lorenzo, the
grandfather of that Giovanni who now was the envoy
in Forlì from the Republic of Florence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIOVANNI DE' MEDICI.</div>

<p>When, therefore, in the early part of the summer of
1497, Catherine gave her hand to Giovanni de' Medici,
however much this, her third marriage, may have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
a matter of calculated prudence and state policy, she
at least had a sufficient knowledge of the man whom
she was about to make her husband. Madama was
now thirty-five years of age, while Giovanni was only
thirty. He had not, and has never occupied any very
conspicuous place in history; but what little we hear
of him is favourable. He had fought with credit, in
France, under Charles VIII., and had brought back
with him to Florence, a French patent of nobility, and
a pension of two thousand crowns a-year, the gifts of
that monarch. He had also the credit of a wise and
prudent negociator and statesman.</p>

<p>There is extant among the Florence archives a letter
from Savonarola to Catherine, dated from the Convent
of St. Mark, the 18th of June, 1477, of which a few
copies have recently been printed by the Count Carlo
Capponi at Florence. The contents are of little interest,
being merely general exhortations to piety, to
God-fearing conduct in the government of her states.
But it is somewhat remarkable that this letter must
have been written just about the time of her marriage
with Giovanni de' Medici; which yet was, like the
preceding union with Feo, and for the same reasons,
kept perfectly secret. Yet, as there is no reason to
think, that the reforming friar had any correspondence
with Catherine, either previously or subsequently, it
can hardly be doubted, that this letter of exhortation
was motived by the occasion of the marriage; and that
the friar, friar-like, knew all about it, however secret
it may have been kept.</p>

<p>This wholly volunteered and unprefaced preachment
from the friar to a foreign princess, is a trait worth
noting of the social position arrogated to themselves
by the spiritual teachers of that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this union, however, of the great houses of
Sforza and Medici, the most, and indeed the only
important result was the birth of a son baptised
Ludovico, on the 6th of April, in the year 1498. The
name Ludovico was, a few months later, changed to
Giovanni; and this child became that celebrated
Giovanni "Delle Bande Nere," who acquired an
European reputation as the greatest captain of his
day, and from whom descended the long line of
Tuscan Grand-Dukes of the Medicean race. For
Cosmo, his son and Catherine's grandson, succeeded to
that dignity on the extinction of the elder branch of
the family.</p>

<p>Through this Giovanni, moreover, Catherine's
eighth child and seventh son, she is the ancestress of
that Maria de' Medici who became the wife of Henry IV.
of France, and by him the progenitress of all the Bourbons,
who have sat on the thrones of France, Spain,
Naples, Parma, and Lucca; and who, by her daughter
Henrietta, the wife of Charles I., was the mother of an
equally royal, and almost equally pernicious race.</p>

<p>It cannot be said, therefore, that this third marriage
of Catherine was unimportant or barren of results;
though, upon her own fortunes, it had little influence;
for Giovanni, whose health appears to have been for
some time failing, died six months after the birth of his
son, on the 14th of September, 1498.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AGAIN A WIDOW.</div>

<p>His physicians had sent him to one of the little
bathing-places in the Apennines, called St. Piero, in
Bagno. There finding himself becoming rapidly worse,
he sent in haste to call Catherine from Forlì, who
reached his bedside barely in time to receive his last
words; and was thus, for the third time, left a widow
at a moment when every appearance in the political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
horizon seemed to indicate that she was on the eve of
events that would make the protection of a husband,
and a powerful alliance, more necessary to her than it
had ever yet been.</p>

<p>And has not, then, Despotism done well, even on

<p>The true and enlightened believer in a god-governance,
and no devil-governance, of the world, will of
course answer unhesitatingly, No! But to answer
from the conscience, No!&mdash;with faith still as firm as
when the nineteenth century was young and proud
with chimerical hopes&mdash;to answer with convictions
still undefeated by the defeats of '48, for ever No!&mdash;requires,
it must be admitted, a strong and clear belief
in the immutability of the causes that result in human
good and evil; a lively perception of the truth that no
faults of a nation's life can best be remedied by national
death; and such a whole-hearted persuasion of the
universality of God's law of progress as can cast out
all doubt of the fact, that every nation on earth's surface
must either advance to improved civilisation, or
else prepare to quit the scene, as some little improvable
peoples have done and are doing, and leave the valuable
space they occupy to more highly-gifted races.</p>

<p>The Italian writers of every age, from the sixteenth
century to the present day, are naturally inclined to
attribute all the misfortunes of their country to foreign
wrong-doing and aggression. And they date the sunset
of Italian prosperity, as Guicciardini does in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
passage previously referred to, from the French invasion
in the last years of the fifteenth century. But
not even the dangers to be anticipated from the pretensions
of the French monarch, nor the actual presence
of foreign troops on the soil of Italy, could avail to
check, even for a time, the deadly hatred of city
against city.</p>

<p>This had blazed out fatally between Florence and
Pisa in 1496, and was still raging in the early months
of 1499. Pisa was assisted by the Venetians; and the
strength of the two maritime republics seems to have
tried the resources of the Florentines severely. Like
the other second-rate princes of Italy, our "Madama
di Forlì" drove a considerable and important trade in
hireling troops. This species of business was in every
respect profitable to the rulers of these petty states.
They thus, besides pocketing considerable sums, maintained
bodies of troops owing allegiance to them and
fighting under their flag, which their own resources
would have been wholly insufficient to support. And
the power of hiring out these to either of two contending
powers caused their alliance to be bid for by their
more powerful neighbours, and gave them an importance
in the political calculations of the time disproportioned
to the size of their little territories.</p>

<p>Madama had had considerable dealings of this sort
with the Florentines. Ottaviano had taken service
with the wealthy republicans, and drew a handsome
stipend from them as General. Early in 1499 the
Republic had sent proposals for a fresh body of troops,
and Madama desired nothing better than to execute the
order. But times were hard in Forlì, and were daily
threatening to become harder. Pestilence had been
raging throughout the city and territory, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
inopportunely raised the value of the raw material of
armies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROME'S DUES.</div>

<p>Worse still, in March of this year Pope Alexander,
in full conclave, had declared Catherine and sundry
other little potentates of Romagna deposed from their
sovereignties, for not having punctually paid up their
dues to the Apostolic Chamber. Catherine, indeed,
forthwith sent up envoys to Rome&mdash;doctors learned in
law and others&mdash;to point out to Pope Alexander that
there was an outstanding account due to her late husband,
the noble Count Riario, which had not been
settled at the time of Sixtus IV.'s death; and that she
would readily pay anything that at a fair settling might
be found due. One would have thought that a Riario's
wife might have known the Apostolic court better than
to have taken such useless trouble. Did she think
Uncle Sixtus of holy memory was the only Pope who
had a family to found? Of course her envoys were
sent about their business without having been allowed
to speak a syllable of their errand.</p>

<p>These dues, a feudal tribute always reserved to the
Holy See in its bulls of investiture, seem rarely to
have been heard anything of as long as a friendly pope
occupied the chair of St. Peter; but as soon as ever
an excuse was wanted at Rome for getting rid of an
obnoxious princeling, the Holy Father looked up his
ledger and pronounced sentence of dechéance against
the debtor.</p>

<p>Now, Pope Alexander had sons, whom he did not
even take the trouble of calling nephews; and he was,
to say the least, quite as royal-minded as the Franciscan
Sixtus. His eldest hope, Cesare Borgia, was exceeding
royal-minded too. And so the Borgias had to be
founded as well as the Riarii; and, unhappily for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
other princes of Romagna, as well as for Catherine
and her son, upon a much wider foundation.</p>

<p>Thus from the early spring of 1499, things wore a
stormy and troubled appearance at Forlì. Not that it
is to be imagined that Catherine for an instant dreamed
of submitting to the sentence pronounced against her.
Such a course would have been unheard of in her day.
Holy Father might say what he pleased, hail bulls, and
do his worst. The Countess of Forlì would hold her
son's sceptre for him, as long as the walls of the city
and fortress would hold together!</p>

<p>And besides, this old debauchee of a Pope might die
any fine morning. He was well stricken in years, and
his life said to be none of the best. And then there
would be a fresh shuffle of the cards, and a new deal,
with who knows what new fortunes, and Borgias nowhere
in the race.</p>

<p>Meantime it was very desirable to keep on good terms
of friendship with Florence, and Madama accordingly
set about preparing the body of troops desired by the
Republic. But symptoms unpleasant enough of Rome's
ban having already begun to produce dangerous effects
were not slow to manifest themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISAFFECTION.</div>

<p>Two deputies were appointed for each ward of the
city to make out lists of all the men capable of bearing
arms; and the roll having been duly sent in to the
castle, all those named in it were ordered to present
themselves in the space in front of the citadel at a
given hour, to receive, as they were bound to do, their
sovereign's orders.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Catherine and her officers were
there to receive their brave lieges. But time came&mdash;time
went&mdash;and not a man appeared. The lady was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
angered to a degree she rarely suffered herself to
appear; and issued orders that officers should that
night go round to every house in Forlì at midnight,
when the inmates were sure to be found there, and
warn each enrolled man severally, that if he did not
appear at the appointed hour on the morrow, he should
be dangling from a gallows before the next nightfall.
But the result of this vigorous measure by no means
tended to mend matters. For the threatened men,
almost to a man, used the remaining hours of that
night to escape from the city; a contingency against
which no provision had been made; as it had never
entered into the head of Catherine or her counsellors
that the daring disaffection of her subjects could proceed
to such lengths. The anger of the baffled sovereign
may be imagined. But it was still worse to find,
from the unusually loud mutterings of the citizens,
that public opinion was in favour of the deserters. One
said that citizens unaccustomed to soldiership could be
of no use in war; another, that it was hard for men
with families to be called on to abandon them for
Madama's affairs, and merely because she willed it;
while others, more daringly meddling with matters of
state policy, maintained, that it was against all reason
that Forlì should unite herself with Florence, which
could be of no use to her, against the Venetians, with
whom was the principal commerce of the city.</p>

<p>The incident was assuredly an ominous one. But
Catherine was not to be easily frightened or diverted
from her intent; and for this time the required levies
were obtained from the apparently more docile and
more long-suffering peasants of the territory.</p>

<p>A little later in July of this year 1499, we find the
Florentines again negotiating with Catherine, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
less a man than Niccolò Macchiavelli was the agent
sent to her by the Republic. The written instructions
received by him from the Signory on the occasion of
this embassy, and seven letters from him to the Gonfolonière
and council, giving an account of his proceedings,
have been printed from the originals preserved in
the Archives at Florence.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The business in hand was the signing of a new
engagement for another year with the Count Ottaviano,
as general in the army of the Republic. The young
count was now just twenty years old. But he does not
appear to have taken any part in the matter, leaving
his mother to make the best bargain for his services
that she could. But Florence wanted to reduce his
pay from the twelve thousand ducats it had been fixed
at the previous year, to ten thousand; and this was the
point which Macchiavelli was urged to use all his state-craft
and subtilty in gaining. The arguments used,
the considerations put forward, and the weighing of the
probabilities as to the opposite party yielding or holding
out, are very amusingly similar in tone and turn of
mind, to those of any Florentine driving a hard bargain
at the present day; and show us the learned and profound
Secretary of the Republic almost a match for
any chafferer of the Mercato nuovo.</p>

<p>He alleges the exhausted condition of the Florentine
treasury for the moment; enlarges much on the advantages
to be drawn from the friendship of Florence, and
speaks largely of her well-known gratitude to her supporters.
At the same time he points out, that the
present proposition of the Republic is solely motived
by its wish to continue a connexion honourable to both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
parties, as, for the present, it has absolutely no need of
the noble Count's services.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MACCHIAVELLI AT FORLÌ.</div>

<p>But the astute Secretary had met with a match for
his diplomacy. Catherine said, that she had ever
found the Florentines, as now, abounding in most
satisfactory assurances and courteous words, but
that their acts matched badly with them. She
thought she merited better treatment at their hands,
having exposed her State to the inroads of the Venetians
by her faithful adherence to them. She wished
nothing but to continue on the good and friendly terms
they had hitherto been on. And as for this matter of
the reduction of the salary, it pained her, because it
was seeming to cast a slight upon her son to diminish
his appointments, while those of other generals were
maintained by the Republic at the old amount.
Besides, there was the Duke of Milan, her relative,
now offering to engage Ottaviano at twelve thousand
ducats: and what excuse could she make to him, if
she refused his offer, and accepted a worse one from
Florence? Then again, the stipend due for last year
had not been paid yet; and really she wished to see
that settled before entering on new engagements.</p>

<p>Macchiavelli writes home, that he strove hard to
content her with good words, saying everything he
could think of to cajole her; but was forced to come
away convinced, he says, that "words and reasoning
will not avail much to satisfy her, unless some partial
performance be added to them." As to this offer
from the Duke of Milan, he fears there may be some
grounds of apprehension concerning it, as Messer
Giovanni Casale, the Duke's envoy, had been at Forlì
for the last two months, and evidently had much influence
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>It is amusing, knowing as we do right well, what was
in the minds of either party, to read the abundance of
complimentary speeches, duly detailed by the careful
secretary, in which all these bargainings were carefully
wrapped up.</p>

<p>At last Macchiavelli writes home to his masters to
the effect, that he thinks they must pay off the old
score, and increase their present offer to twelve thousand
ducats. And the treaty was eventually signed for
that amount.</p>

<p>There are signs however in these letters of Macchiavelli,
that the Florentine coffers were really running
low. The envoy had been instructed to ask for a body
of 500 troops; and writes back, that they may be had;
and that Catherine will take all care to send picked
men, well armed, and faithful;&mdash;<i>but</i> that the cash must
be sent beforehand, five hundred ducats at the least,
before a man could march. If the above sum were
sent, they might reckon on having the five hundred men
before Pisa in fifteen days; but the ready cash was an
absolute sine-quâ-non. And the result of this communication
from the envoy was, that the Signory suffered
the negociation quietly to drop.</p>

<p>Then come orders to purchase sundry war-stores and
ammunitions; to which the reply is, that Catherine had
neither powder nor balls to spare, being but badly provided
for her own exigences. To show however her
wish to do everything in her power for the Republic,
Madama had consented to let the Signory have the half
of a parcel of twenty thousand pounds of nitre, which
she had succeeded in purchasing at Pesaro.</p>

<p>And so on the 25th of July Macchiavelli left Forlì,
having been obliged to yield every point in dispute to
our business-like heroine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">EVIL DAYS.</div>

<p>But the evil days were at hand. Louis XII.,
who had succeeded to Charles VIII., entered into
a league with the Venetians and Pope Alexander, with
the understanding that the king should be assisted in
seizing the Duchy of Milan, while Cesare Borgia was
to be helped to possess himself of the various small
principalities of Romagna, specially those of Imola and
Forlì. Early in November, Borgia with a numerous
army, chiefly French, appeared before Imola. Ottaviano
hurried thither immediately, and having done what
he could to persuade the little city to make a vigorous
defence, returned to the more important care of
preparing Forlì to stand a siege.</p>

<p>Imola surrendered at the first summons of Borgia.
But not so did Dionigi Naldi the <i>Castellano</i> of the fortress.
To every threat of the enemy he replied, that
he was determined to do his duty to the last; and in
fact only yielded when the fortress had been battered
into ruins around him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Madama and her son were taking every
means to defend Forlì. The country was laid waste
around, and everything portable brought into the city.
The fortifications were repaired, Ottaviano himself
labouring as a porter to encourage his subjects, and
Madama herself personally superintending the work.
But the conduct of Imola made Catherine feel, that
unless the Forlìvesi really intended to stand by her and
defend their city, it would be much wiser to employ all
her efforts in preparing for an obstinate resistance in
the fortress, and leave the town to itself. She therefore
determined to call a general council of the citizens, and
invite every one to speak his opinion freely on the measures
to be adopted, for raising the necessary supplies.
Her own plans and intentions were first fully explained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
and then any who had objections to make were desired
to speak. Whereupon many rose to put forward
different views, to whom the superior advantages of the
lady's plans were duly pointed out. But it so happened,
that the objectors were still unconvinced. Whereupon
Madama became so angered, that "she regarded this
circumstance as an abuse of her kindness; and being
resolved to tolerate such opposition no further, caused
a gallows to be forthwith raised on the piazza, and a
rack to be erected by the side of it; wishing thus to
let it be understood to the terror of all, that, though
her goodness was great, it had its limits."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Yet these conciliatory measures do not seem to have
had all the effect that could have been desired on the
minds of the citizens. For notwithstanding the persuasive
nature of the arguments mentioned above, it
seems, that the result of one or two other councils of
her lieges finally convinced Catherine that no hope was
to be placed in the fidelity of the city; and that she
had nothing to look to but the strength of the fortress,
and her own energy in defending it.</p>

<p>In these nearly desperate circumstances the still
undaunted Countess determined on the 11th of December
to send her son away into Tuscany, that <i>his</i> safety
at least might in case of the worst be secured, while she
remained to face the storm. The division between the
town and the citadel now became complete. The citizens
made no longer any secret of their intentions to
open their gates to Borgia, and tender him their allegiance;
while all those who were personal adherents
of the Riarii, or who determined still to link their fortunes
with that of Madama and her sons retreated into
the fortress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CATHERINE AT BAY!</div>

<p>The citizens had thus abandoned and defied in her
danger and extremity the high-handed and haughty
mistress, before whom they had so often trembled; and
were doubtless congratulating themselves in having
been permitted so easily to change their allegiance from
a sinking house to one in the ascendant, when they
were suddenly reminded that they were not yet well
"off with the old love," by the opening of the fortress
guns on the city. The astonishment was great, that
Catherine, who must well know that she would shortly
have need of every arm and every ounce of powder she
could muster, should thus commence a contest with a
second enemy, as if the Borgia were not enough. But
the proud Dame held that all those who were not for
her, were against her; and could ill brook the disobedience
and desertion of her vassals. But this cannonading
her own city, was, under any provocation, an act
but poorly excusable by the motives set forth in its
defence by Burriel;&mdash;that the enemy might not suppose
that she was an acquiescing party in the abandonment
of the city, or that she was alarmed or discouraged
by it.</p>

<p>On the other hand it must not be imagined that the
injury inflicted on the citizens by such a measure was
in any way comparable to that which we naturally picture
to ourselves, as the result of firing on a city from
the walls of a fortress. The proportion between the
means of offence and defence at the disposal of European
combatants, has for the last four hundred years
been continually changing in favour of the former. So
that the mischief done in a given time by any military
operations is infinitely greater now than was the case
when Catherine battered Forlì.</p>

<p>On the 19th of December Cesare Borgia made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
triumphal entry into Forlì, with all those theatrical
circumstances of personal pomp and bravery which in
the conceptions of those peacock-like southern idiosyncracies
form so large and essential portion of the idea of
"greatness." The troops and their officers having filed
into the city before him, the great man,&mdash;most wicked,
base, and incapable of any great or noble thought of all
men there;&mdash;the great man, most reverenced, admired,
and obeyed of all men there, advanced stately in full
armour on a white horse, with an heraldically embroidered
silk tunic over his armour, a tall white plume
nodding above his helmet, and in his hand a long green
lance, the point of which rested on the toe of his
boot.</p>

<p>And these well selected properties answered their
purpose so perfectly, that no man in the vast concourse
there guessed, that Cesare Borgia was not a great man,
even when to the considerable discomfiture of all the
scenic arrangements a sudden torrent of rain threatened
to wash out all visible distinction between his Highness
and ordinary mortals. The magistrates and deputation
of nobles, who were receiving him at the gate, turned
and fled in scamping disorder, each man to the nearest
shelter.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Borgia hastily rode round the piazza in performance
of the recognised symbol of taking possession
of the city, and then hurried off to the lodging prepared
for him. But the storm was productive of far more
serious evil to the unfortunate townsfolk. For all the
officers, having hurried away to their various quarters,
no one remained to superintend the billeting of the
soldiers with any regularity. And the consequence
was, that they rushed pell-mell through the city, forcing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
their way into the houses, and finding lodging for themselves
according to their own discretion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILD WORK IN FORLÌ.</div>

<p>The results of this irruption, and of the license
which followed it, were almost equivalent to the sack of
the city. The town became a perfect hell, writes one
chronicler.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The shops were gutted. The <i>Palazzo
Pubblico</i> was almost entirely devastated. The great
council hall was turned into a tavern, and all the seats
burned. The guard-room and the offices of the customs
were made a slaughter-house; and the utmost
confusion and disorder prevailed everywhere. "In the
houses," writes Burriel, "neither could any business
be carried on, nor could their inmates even live there,
as the soldiers entered in parties, made themselves
masters of everything, and ill-treated the owners;&mdash;not
to mention the worse lot of widows, and of those who
had daughters, and could find no place of safety for
them."</p>

<p>The citizens began to find that things could hardly
have been worse with them had they rallied round
their courageous liege lady, and bravely defended their
walls.</p>

<p>Borgia twice had parley with Madama at his request;
and used every argument to induce her to give up the
fortress, wholly in vain. Towards the end of December
the attack was commenced; and for about a week
continued without much result. And then, at the
beginning of the new year and century, a truce was
agreed on for a few days. The French during this
time gave themselves up to festivities and amusements,
which seem not a little to have astonished the more
civilised Italians. For instance, writes one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
historians, D'Aubigny and Galvani, two of Borgia's
generals, lodging in the house of Messer Giovanni Monsignani
determined on inviting a party of their brother
officers. A sufficiently ample banqueting hall was provided
by boarding up the arches of the "loggia" or open
arcade so common in Italian domestic architecture;
and provision for a feast intended to last two entire days
was obtained at small cost by a razzia upon the peasants.
When the guests arrived, they were followed, we are
assured, by a mob of all sorts of people, who, while the
convives sat at table, stood around eating and drinking
all they could lay their hands on. And when the repast
was finished, two men, "according to their barbarous,
and truly too outrageous custom," sprung on the table,
and dancing on it, smashed and destroyed all the plates
and other utensils thereon, and threw the wreck with
all the remnant of the eatables to the ground. "Then
came in an exceedingly long procession of men and
women," (of whom a considerable number, it should
seem, accompanied the camp;) "driving before them a
man on horseback in a long gown and cap like a mitre
on his head. This procession stood around the tables
drinking and making merry, with much laughter. Then
all went out arm in arm, parading the streets, and roaring
out their tasteless disagreeable songs to the exceeding
wonder of the Forlìvesi."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> We can easily believe
it;&mdash;easily imagine too the scene produced by the Lord
of Misrule, who may probably be recognised in the
gentleman with the long gown and mitre, and his roystering
crew of roaring swash-bucklers startling the
echoes from the tall stone walls of the old Italian town,
amid the cautious peeping of the scared and scandalised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
burghers, quite at a loss to understand the meaning
and intention of this strange manifestation of the
barbarians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BEGINNING OF THE END.</div>

<p>On the 10th of January, 1500, the attack on the
fortress was renewed, and by mid-day on the 12th,
the breach was nearly practicable. Borgia left the
attack, we are told, at that hour, to go to dinner! and
while at table, made a bet of thirty ducats with some of
his officers, that he would have Catherine in his hands
within three days. Returning to the walls, he found
that fortune had prepared for him a more rapid victory
than he had hoped for. Either by treachery, as the
Forlì historians, of course, maintain, or by the efforts
of the enemy, a fire had broken out in the fort, which
paralysed the garrison; and driving them from their
defences, caused the principal part of the fortifications
to fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>The case was now clearly hopeless; but Catherine
retiring into the principal tower, still stood at bay.
At the same time another tower, which had served as
the magazine, and into which a large number of the
enemy had penetrated, was fired by some of Catherine's
people; and all those within it met with a fearful death.
This act of useless cruelty so exasperated the soldiers
of Borgia, that a general massacre of the garrison was
commenced. At this juncture, Borgia once again
demanded to parley with the Countess, who accordingly
presented herself at a window of her tower. They
spoke together at length, while he strove to persuade
her of the uselessness of prolonging the struggle. But
while she still stood at the window speaking with him,
a French soldier, who had found some means of
entrance into the tower, stepped up behind her, and
made her prisoner in the name of his captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>All this took place on the afternoon of the 12th of
January. Catherine was that night kept prisoner in
the citadel, where Borgia and the French general
visited her, and talked with her, it is recorded, for
more than an hour;&mdash;an hour sufficiently bitter, one
may suppose, to that haughty dame, who had to listen
to the courtesies of her captors, while the sounds of
falling masonry, and exploding mines, the shouts of
the pursuers, and the cries of the conquered as they
fell, ever and anon came through the thick walls, and
gave clear evidence of the work of destruction which
was in progress.</p>

<p>The Forlì historians recount at much length the
cruelties and insults which their forefathers had to
suffer from the victorious barbarian army during
several days,&mdash;the insatiable rapacity of all classes of
the soldiers, the wanton destruction of that which
could not be appropriated, and the general devastation
of the city. But all this is unhappily too common,
and too well known a story, to need repeating here.</p>

<p>History has for centuries been preaching to mankind
from her great stock text, on war and its consequences;&mdash;and
at last not so wholly in vain, as in
the good old time. But if so terrible an amount of
evil be inseparable from the most glorious war,&mdash;and
the valorous assertion of right, against wrong-doing
might is, and must ever be, glorious,&mdash;what shall be
said of slaughter-matches, in which no high idea or
noble feeling had any, the least share; by which the
basest passions are intensified, the lowest motives alone
brought into action, with only this distinction, that the
higher the social rank of the "noble soldier," the baser
were the objects he proposed to himself as the prizes
of the fight!</p>

<div class="sidenote">ONCE MORE TO ROME.</div>

<p>Towards the end of January, Borgia left Forlì,
wholly submitted to his authority, and led away his
noble captive to Rome. Catherine, clothed, it is
recorded, in a black satin dress, made the journey on
horseback, riding between her conqueror and one of
the French generals. She arrived in Rome on the
26th of February, 1500. And, as she once again
entered that Porta del Popolo, the dethroned widow
can hardly have failed to contrast the circumstances
of her return with those of her first arrival in the
Eternal City.</p>

Florence.&mdash;Her cloister life with the Murate nuns.&mdash;Her collection

<p class="pn p2">Passing along the same line of streets which she had
traversed twenty-three years before as the bride of the
then wealthiest and most powerful man in Rome,&mdash;as
much an object of curiosity now as then to the sight-loving
populace, eager to stare at the celebrated prisoner
of the now wealthiest and most powerful man in Rome,
as then to welcome the great man's bride,&mdash;Catherine
was led by her captor to the Vatican. Up the well-known
stair, and through the familiar chambers, lined,
when last she passed across them, with a crowd of
bending courtiers, anxious to catch a word or glance
from the powerful favourite, who held all Apostolic
graces in her hand, she passed on to the presence of
the Pontiff.</p>

<p>Alexander received her courteously; assigned an
apartment in the Belvidere of the Vatican as her
prison, and assured her, that no care should be wanting
to make her residence there as little irksome as was
consistent with the precautions necessary to secure her
safe custody.</p>

<p>No doubt the haughty lady replied to the Sovereign
Pontiff, who, when last they had met, had been too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
happy in being honoured with her friendship, with
equal courtesy. But the feelings in the breast of
either interlocutor, which were thus decorously veiled,
may be easily estimated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACCUSATION AGAINST HER.</div>

<p>And it was not long before the genuine hatred
pierced through the flimsy sham of courtly politeness.
In the month of June&mdash;that is, four months after her
arrival in Rome&mdash;an accusation was brought against
Catherine of having attempted to destroy the Pope by
poison. The story put forward was one strangely
characteristic of medieval modes of thinking and
acting.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> It was asserted that when Catherine heard in
the spring of 1499, that the Pope had judicially
declared her deposed from her sovereignty, she had at
once determined on compassing his death. With this
view, she had caused certain letters, written by her to
the Pontiff, to be placed inside the clothing, on the
breast of one dying of the plague, then prevalent in
Forlì. These letters, having thus been rendered
deadly to whoso should touch them, were consigned
to a certain confidential servant of the Countess,
named Battista, with orders to proceed to Rome, and
deliver the papers into no hand save that of Alexander
himself. This man, the accusation went on to say,
met in Rome one Cristoforo Balatrone, a former
servant of the Riarii, then in disgrace with his mistress;
and confided to him the real object of the mission
intrusted to him, promising him restoration to
Catherine's favour, if he would assist in the execution
of it.</p>

<p>The accusation, therefore, it will be observed, supposed
that Catherine did not merely avail herself of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
this servant's aid, as a courier to carry the letters and
deliver them as ordered, which would have been all
that was needful, but unnecessarily, as it would seem,
confided to him the fatal secret of her intentions.</p>

<p>Cristoforo, it was said, instead of acquiescing in
Battista's proposal, persuaded the latter to reveal the
whole to the Pontiff. For that purpose they forthwith
proceeded to the Vatican. It was late in the evening,
and they were bidden by one Tommaso Carpi, the
Pope's chamberlain, and who was also, as it happened,
a Forlì man, to return on the morrow if they wished
an audience. In the mean time Cristoforo, not being
able to keep so great a secret for so many hours,
related the whole matter to his brother, a private in
the Papal guards. The soldier immediately reported
the story to his captain; and he, thinking promptitude
necessary in such a case, forthwith arrested both
Cristoforo and Battista, and made the Pope acquainted
with all the circumstances on the following morning.
Alexander knowing, it was said (although at that
period he could have known nothing of the sort, but
could only have hoped it), that Catherine would shortly
be brought to Rome, ordered that these men should
be kept in secret confinement till the arrival of the
Countess.</p>

<p>According to this story, therefore, Alexander was
aware of Catherine's murderous intentions at the time
of that courteous reception we read of. But then, and
for four months afterwards, no such accusation was heard
of. At the end of that time Catherine was submitted
to the humiliation of being confronted with the two
men who testified to this accusation, before Alexander
himself. To our ideas it would seem that there must
have been various means of proving or disproving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
facts in question. The letters might have been produced,
and means of ascertaining their contagiousness
devised. But juridical and medical science were in
far too barbarous a state, and still more fatally the
sentiment of fairness and appreciation of the desirableness
of truth, far too much deadened for any such
mode of proceeding to have been thought of. The
witnesses maintained their story by their assertion;
Catherine utterly denied that there was any truth in
any part of it; and the whole scope of the examination
seems to have been to see which party would most
obstinately adhere to their assertion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MEDIEVAL JURISPRUDENCE.</div>

<p>In an ordinary case the obstinacy would quickly
have been more satisfactorily tested by placing the
accused on the rack. But even a Pope, and that Pope
Alexander VI., would hardly venture to apply the
torture to Catherine Sforza. The examination, therefore
appears to have resulted in a battledore-and-shuttlecock
iteration of "You did," and "I did not,"
so much to the advantage of the lady, that one<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> of her
biographers writes triumphantly of her, that "Although
confronted with those who audaciously accused her
of having sent them to Rome for that purpose, she,
with a virile and intrepid mind, conquered by her
obstinate constancy the wicked will of Alexander."</p>

<p>This wicked will was not, however, so completely
vanquished as to prevent the accused, though not
convicted, Countess from being immediately transferred
from the Belvidere to the castle of St. Angelo;
to the prisons of which ill-omened fortress she was
consigned on the 26th of June.</p>

<p>And all the probabilities of the case seem to indicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
that the accusation was trumped up merely to justify
this change in the Countess' place of confinement.
Catherine, while she lived, was likely to be ever as
tormenting a thorn in the side of Cæsare Borgia,
as the ousted Ordelaffi pretenders had been in
hers, even during the Pontiff's life. And after that,
when the new sovereign of Romagna would have
to maintain himself in his position unaided by Apostolic
influence, she would be a far more dangerous
enemy. Yet the rank and connections of Catherine,
and her own reputation and character and standing
among the princes of Italy were such, that it was
requisite to proceed warily in any attempt to get rid
of her. A good pretext was necessary to justify even
the rigour of imprisoning her in St. Angelo. But
that step taken, the rest would not be so difficult.
Those once hidden in the dreadful vaults of that huge
mass of old Roman masonry, were too completely cut
off from all communication with the outer world, for
there to be any possibility of marking their passage
from the living tomb, to the veritable grave within its
walls. Papal dungeons reveal no secrets; and there
can be little doubt that, but for the interposition of an
arm more powerful than that of the Pontiff, Catherine
would never have recrossed that threshold passed by
so many unreturning feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER RESPECT FOR THE POPE.</div>

<p>As to the real guilt of our heroine in this matter, it
must be admitted that the presumption in her favour
rests more on the improbability of the means said to
have been selected by her, and on the incredibility of
Alexander's having suppressed all mention of the crime
for four months, rather than on any conviction that she
would have been incapable of any such atrocity. That
Catherine would without hesitation or scruple take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
human life&mdash;nay, many human lives&mdash;on the provocation
of wrong much lighter than that received by
her from the Pontiff, is clear enough; but it is true,
that many, most probably, of her contemporaries, who
would have never thought twice of sending burgher
or peasant to the rack or gallows in a fit of passing
passion, would have shrunk from poisoning a Pope.
The atrocity of the deed, in the estimation of the contemporary
writers, is derived from the sacred character
and high rank of its object. And these are considerations
which, it may be fairly supposed from what we
have seen of Catherine, would be likely to influence her
less than they might have done others. It is difficult
to believe that Popes were very sacred personages in
her eyes. She had been too much behind the scenes
to be much under the influence of stage illusion. And,
in a word, it will be felt, if the foregoing pages have at
all succeeded in picturing this masterful woman to the
reader as she appears to the writer, that she was not
likely to have turned away from any means that presented
themselves to her of removing out of her path
any individual, be he who he might, whose existence
seemed fatal to the objects for which she had lived and
struggled.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for the reasons above stated, it seems
more probable that the accusation in question was
trumped up for the sake of furnishing an opportunity
to the Pope of taking her life, which was almost as
dangerous to his aims, as his life was to her. And
had it not been for the powerful interference of the
French king, doubtless Catherine would never have
come out alive from the dungeons of St. Angelo. One
of the historians<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> simply says that she owed her life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
to the protection of France. Things were not in a
position to render it possible that Alexander should act
in defiance of the remonstrances of Louis XII.; and
Catherine was liberated on the 30th of June, 1501.</p>

<p>Having remained at Rome a few days among her
relatives and connections of the house of Riario, she
left it for the last time on the 27th of July, and went
to Florence. All her children by her three husbands
had already found an asylum there; where, in consideration
of her third marriage, rights of citizenship
had, by an instrument bearing date the 27th of July,
1498, been conferred on all of them.</p>

<p>It is not without a certain feeling of surprise that
one remembers that Catherine, after a career so full of
incident, comprising three married lives and three
widowhoods, was now only thirty-nine years of age.
The active and useful portion of many an existence
begins at as late a period. But Catherine seems to
have felt that she had lived her life, and that the active
portion of her career was over. Almost immediately
on arriving in Florence, she selected the convent of
the Murate as the place of her retirement; and she
never afterwards quitted it.</p>

<p>More than one change in the political world occurred
during the years she passed there, which seemed calculated
to make a place for her once again upon the
great scene of Europe, and perhaps to open a path for
her return to sovereign place and power. Alexander
VI. died in 1503; and, after a few months' occupation
of the Papal throne by Pius III., Giuliano della
Rovere, first cousin of Girolamo Riario, was elected
and became Pope under the name of Julius II. It is
true that this warrior Pope did not subsequently
appear disposed to lend any helping hand to his Riari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
cousins for the recovery of their dominions; but the
elevation of a cousin to the chair of St. Peter might
well call forth from the cloister one who had any wish
remaining to play a part in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT THE MURATE.</div>

<p>But Catherine remained quiet in the monotonous
repose of her cell in the Via Ghibellina, and did not
disturb herself to make even the smallest attempt at
obtaining the favour of the new Pontiff. It must be
concluded that she had in truth abandoned the world,
with an earnestness of purpose more durable than is
usually the case with such votaries of seclusion.</p>

<p>Yet few can have ever experienced a more violent
change than that suffered by this strong-willed woman
in passing from a life so filled with movement, excitement,
activity, danger, pains, pleasures, and vicissitudes,
to the dead tranquillity of a secure cloister cell.
Her priest biographer<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> hints that the macerations, fasts,
and austerities practised by her during her residence
at the Murate, were such as in all probability to have
shortened her life. Having followed with infinite complacency
the worldly triumphs and grandeurs of his
heroine, as long as devoutly worshipped Mammon had
rewards to shower on his votary, the greedy biographer
seeks to finish off his picture by adding a little halo of
sanctity, and thus claims double honours for his
client.</p>

<p>But there is reason to think that these severe
penances are wholly the creatures of the writer's
priestly invention. The Murate, at the period of
Catherine's retirement there, was not the place any
penitent would have selected for the leading of an
austere life. The convent was inhabited exclusively by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
noble ladies, and some picture of the life led there by
them, has been given by the present writer in speaking
of the residence there of another Catherine<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> a few
years afterwards. Her childhood was passed within
the same cloister-wall that had sheltered the decline of
that namesake whose character presented so many
striking points of similarity to her own.</p>

<p>It is not likely that the Murate convent was the
scene of any severe austerities. But if no spiritual
excitement of this sort supplied for Catherine the
place of that which she had lost, the hours of the long
day, however diversified by matins, lauds, complines,
and vesper amusements, must surely have passed
heavily.</p>

<p>A very curious MS. volume,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> copied from one in
Catherine's own handwriting, may perhaps indicate the
disposal of some of those weary hours. It consists of
more than five hundred receipts and experiments in
medicine, chemistry, cosmetics, perfumery, alchemy,
&amp;c. The practice of forming and preserving such collections
seems to have been a common one among the
ladies of that time; and various similar volumes may
be met with. In a short preface, the copier of Catherine's
manuscript, a certain Messer Lucantonio Cuppani,
declares that he has tested many of the receipts
and found the results perfectly satisfactory, and that
he doubts not that the rest are equally trustworthy,
seeing that so great a woman had recorded them;
wherefore he has made the present copy, lest the knowledge
of such wonderful secrets might be lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COINING SECRETS.</div>

<p>Many of these valuable secrets are of a nature to
be only too really valuable in the hands of a sovereign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
possessing a mint of her own. The papal bull
authorising the coining of money at Forlì contains a
special provision for the goodness of the metal. But
the following entries, in the royal-minded Catherine's
own hand, suggest strong doubts of the condition
having been duly observed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To convert pewter into silver of the finest quality
and of standard alloy."</p>

<p>"For giving to bars of brass a fine golden colour."</p>

<p>Several receipts, "For multiplying silver."</p>

<p>More curious and suspicious still, is the possession
of a method by which "to give weight to a crown or
ducat of gold, <i>without hurting the conscience</i>&mdash;senza
carico di coscienza"!</p>

<p>A great number refer to subjects, which we must
suppose to have been more interesting to Catherine at
an earlier period of her life, than when living among
"the wall'd-up Nuns." As, for instance, a receipt "to
drive away pallor from the face, and give it a colour."
For this purpose, roots of myrrh must be shred into
good generous wine; then "drink sufficiently of that,
and it will give you a carnation of the most beautiful."
This is probably one of the receipts tried, and found
to answer by Messer Lucantonio.</p>

<p>Then we have a water to preserve the skin against
blotches; another to make the teeth white; and a third
to make the gums red; and very many others for the
beautification of almost every part of the person.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the medical "secrets," of which a
great number are treasured up in this curious volume,
the following may be cited: For infirm lungs, an
ointment is to be made of the blood of a hen, a duck,
a pig, a goose, mixed with fresh butter and white wax.
And this is to be applied to the chest on a fox's skin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
In which the fox-skin holds a place analogous to that
of the six pounds of beef in the well-known recipe for
making stone soup.</p>

<p>More problematical is a receipt for "a drink to
make splintered bones come out of the wound of
themselves."</p>

<p>There are many examples of sick-room practice,
based on curious combinations of medical with theological
treatment; as in the following method for
healing sabre wounds: "Take three pieces of an old
shirt, steeped in holy water, and bind them on the
wound in the form of a cross. The wound must have
been carefully washed; and the patient must have no
offensive arms about him. He must say three <i>paters</i>
and three <i>aves</i> off; if he cannot, some one must say
them for him. For the success of this cure, it is
necessary that both the wounded man and the operator
be in a state of bodily purity."</p>

<p>The following must probably be one of those which
good Lucantonio did not make trial of, but took on
trust undoubtingly, from his faith in the noble author's
"greatness:" "To make a toad cast his stone. Take
a toad of those which have a red head. Place him in
a cage, and put the cage upon a piece of scarlet cloth;
and early in the morning, set it in the ray of the rising
sun. The toad will look fixedly at the sun; and you
must let him remain there for three hours. And at
the end of that time he will cast forth a stone which
has three virtues: 1st, It is specific against poison;
2nd, It is good to staunch blood; 3rd, When a horse
is in pain, grate some of the stone, and make him
drink it."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER MEDICAL SECRETS.</div>

<p>There are among these valuable secrets, waters
"to make iron hard;" "to make it as brittle as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
glass;" "to dissolve pearls;" "to dissolve all metals;"
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>There are no less than thirteen different specifics
against witchcraft.</p>

<p>Then, if you would know whether a sick person will
recover, you must "clean the face of the sick with
warm paste, and then give the paste to a dog. If the
dog should eat the paste, the sick man will recover; if
not, he will die."</p>

<p>Lastly, there are a great number of a kind that, less
than any of the others, should have been of any interest
to the recluse of the Murate; such as love philtres,
specifics against sterility and other kindred inconveniences.
Several are for purposes set forth by the
noble lady with the utmost cynical directness of terms,
but which cannot, under any veil of phrase, be even
indicated here. And some instructions there are,
which would place any modern English man or woman
acting on them, in a very disagreeable position in the
dock of the Old Bailey; but which are here, by some
theological sharp practice, so cleverly and piously
managed, as to attain their object, "<i>senza carico di
coscienza</i>."</p>

<p>It would seem, too, that, startling as is the cynicism
of some of the language which Messer Lucantonio has
not scrupled to copy in his best text-hand, some of the
lady's secrets must have been of a yet more abominable
description. For passages in cipher frequently occur
in a context, which indicates that such has been the
reason for so veiling them.</p>

<p>In short, there is to be found in the pages of this
strangely curious and tell-tale volume, abundant evidence
that the woman who could collect, transcribe,
and find an interest in preserving such "secrets," as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
many of those here, must, according to English nineteenth-century
codes and feelings, have been lost to
every sense of decency, and deplorably ignorant of the
laws, and even of the true nature of morality. But
there is no reason to think that Catherine fell in these
respects at all lower than the general level of her age
and country. There is ample proof, on the contrary,
that in these, as in all other matters, Catherine was
essentially a woman of her time&mdash;in no respect in
advance of her time, or behind it; but furnishing
a full and fair expression and type of her age and
class, as is ever the case with vigorous, bustling,
strong, practical natures of her stamp. The men,
who are before their time, whose domain is the future,
to their utter exclusion from all dominion over the
present, are of another sort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BIOGRAPHIC JUDGMENTS.</div>

<p>The writers and readers of biographies are, as it seems
to the author of the present, too much wont to feel
themselves called upon to express, or at least to form a
judgment, as to the amount of moral approbation or
condemnation to be awarded to the object of their
examination. They continually suffer their thoughts
to be drawn from the legitimate and useful study of
their subject, by a constant consideration of the judgment
to be passed on such or such individual soul by
the one all-seeing Judge, alone competent to solve any
such question. They talk of "making allowance," as
the phrase goes; and spend much weighing on the
quantum of such allowance admissible. Vain speculation
surely, and quite beside the purpose! Not on
the ground of "charitable construction" being due,
and of "judging not," &amp;c. (for lack of charity towards
a fellow-creature, or other evil passion whatever, can
hardly find place in our thoughts of one, whose exit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
from our scene was four centuries ago), but because
such questions are insoluble, and if they were soluble,
would be unprofitable. For we are not in the position
of the bedside physician, whose duty is to alleviate the
pangs of the sufferer, and to struggle against the individual
malady by individual appliances. We are in
the place of the <i>post-mortem</i> anatomist, who, without
reference to the sufferings of the deceased, has only to
ascertain that a certain amount of mischief to the
machine he is examining, resulted from such and such
circumstances. And this information is useful only on
account of his persuasion that other similar machines
will be in like circumstances similarly affected.</p>

<p>We have no need, therefore, of any of that feeling
of the moral pulse, which might be useful for the priest
or philosopher, who would "minister to a mind diseased."
We have only to ascertain that a certain
amount of deviation from moral health existed under
such and such circumstances. And this, in as much as
the laws which govern our ethical constitution are as
immutable as those which rule the physical world, is an
investigation of infinite and eternal interest. Under
the influence of such and such social constitutions,
spiritual teachings, and modes of living, this case of
moral disease was generated. Here is a practically
useful fact. And if it should appear that, under those
same influences this malady was epidemic, the interest
of the case assumes larger proportions.</p>

<p>Altogether dismissing from our minds, therefore, all
considerations of our poor defunct subject's blameableness,
and deservings, and all weighing of allowances
wholly imponderable in any scales of ours, let us heedfully
observe and reflect on the proved facts of the
case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>This poor Catherine, born, as our autopsy shows,
with so strong, vigorous, and large a nature, came to
be savagely reckless of human life, and blood-thirsty in
her vengeance; came to be so grossly material in her
mode of regarding that part of our nature, which, duly
spiritualised, contributes much to our preparation for
eternity, but which, unspiritualised, most draws us to
the level of the lower animals, as to be capable of
<i>writing</i> such things as have been alluded to; came
lastly to consider all distinction between right and
wrong, and God's eternal laws to be of the nature of an
Act of Parliament carelessly drawn, through which,
by sharp-witted dexterity, coaches-and-four, as the
saying goes, might be driven with impunity; came, we
say, to be all this as the result of the teaching offered
her by all around her in that great fifteenth century, of
the spiritual guidance afforded her by those "ages of
faith," and living heart-felt religion, and of the social
ideas produced by the medieval relationship between
the governors of mankind and their subjects.</p>

<p>Catherine continued to reside with the Murate nuns
till the time of her death, in the year 1509, the forty-seventh
of her age. She made a long and accurately
drawn will, characterised by the justice and good sense
with which she partitioned what belonged to her among
the children of her three marriages; and was buried in
the chapel of the convent; where her monument was
still visible, although, strangely enough, its inscribed
altar tombstone had at some period been turned face
downwards, and where her remains reposed till they
were (literally) dispersed a few years ago, on occasion
of the old Murate convent being converted into a state
prison.</p>

<p class="pbqi">Changes in the Condition of Italy.&mdash;Dark Days.&mdash;Circumstances which
led to the Invasion of the French.&mdash;State of things in Naples.&mdash;Fall
of the Arragonese Dynasty.&mdash;Birth of Vittoria.&mdash;The Colonna.&mdash;Marino.&mdash;Vittoria's

Culture at Naples.&mdash;Education of Vittoria in Ischia.</p>

<p class="pn p2">A number of years less than sufficient for the
passing away of one generation elapsed between the
birth of Catherine Sforza and that of Vittoria
Colonna. The latter was celebrating her marriage,
with life all decked in its gayest hues, and lighted
with its brightest sunshine spread out before her, in
the same year in which the stout-hearted old châtelaine,
wearied and world-sick was dying out of sight in a
cloister. But the passage of these few years had
brought about events that furnished forth a changed
scene for the younger lady to play her part on. The
second dark age of Italy, according to the historians,
was about to commence. The bad times were at hand.
The change, we are told by the recorders of it, was all
for the worse. And in truth it might well appear so,
to all, save those whose faith forbids them to believe in
any change for the worse, and whose patience can
afford to allow the world-ph&oelig;nix, as Carlyle says, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
long time,&mdash;say, as regards Italy, some four hundred
years or so&mdash;for burning herself.</p>

<p>The process has not, it must be admitted, been a
pleasant one; and those years at the beginning of it
were assuredly not pleasant times to those whose lot
was cast in them.</p>

<p>The French came down on the country to light up
the pyre; the Spaniards followed to make matters
worse; Holy Fathers, the only Heaven-given guidance
known, went from bad to worse, till badness culminated
in a Borgia; new ideas too were bred, like flies
in the heat, coming from no man knew where,&mdash;leading,
assuredly no man then living guessed whither,&mdash;and
promising in the long run to give more trouble than
either French, Spaniards, or Popes,&mdash;all tended to
make a troublous, yeasty, seething time of our Vittoria's
life-span.</p>

<p>The signs of change, which were perplexing monarchs
at the period of her entry on the scene, belonged
simply to the material order of things; and such broad
outline of them, as is necessary to give some idea of
the general position of Italy at that day, may be drawn
in few words.</p>

<p>Certain more important symptoms of changes in the
world of thought and speculation, did not rise to the
surface of society till a few years later, and these will
have to be spoken of in a subsequent page.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRENCH INVADE ITALY.</div>

<p>When Galeazzo Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan, was
murdered in 1476, his son, Gian Galeazzo, a minor,
succeeded to the dukedom. But his uncle Ludovico,
known in history as "Ludovico il Moro," under pretence
of protecting his nephew, usurped the whole
power and property of the crown, which he continued
wrongfully to keep in his own hands even after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
majority of his nephew. The latter, however, having
married a grand-daughter of Ferdinand of Arragon,
King of Naples, her father, Alphonso, heir apparent
of that crown, became exceedingly discontented at the
state of tutelage in which his son-in-law was thus
held. And his remonstrances and threats became so
urgent, that "Black Ludovick" perceived that he
should be unable to retain his usurped position, unless
he could find means of disabling Ferdinand and his
son Alphonso from exerting their strength against him.
With this view he persuaded Charles VIII. of France to
undertake with his aid the conquest of the kingdom of
Naples, to which the French monarch asserted a claim,
derived from the house of Anjou, which had reigned in
Naples, till they were ousted by the house of Arragon.
This invitation, which the Italian historians consider
the first fountain head of all their calamities, was given
in 1492. On the 23rd of August, 1494, Charles left
France on his march to Italy, and arrived in Rome on
the 31st of December of that year.</p>

<p>On the previous 25th of January, Ferdinand, the old
King of Naples, died, and his son, Alphonso, succeeded
him. But the new monarch, who during the latter
years of his father's life had wielded the whole power
of the kingdom, was so much hated by his subjects,
that on the news of the French King's approach they
rose in rebellion and declared in favour of the invader.
Alphonso made no attempt to face the storm, but
forthwith abdicated in favour of his son Ferdinand,
fled to Sicily, and "set about serving God," as the
chroniclers phrase it, in a monastery, where he died a
few months later, on the 19th of November, 1495.</p>

<p>Ferdinand II., his son, was not disliked by the
nation; and Guicciardini gives it as his opinion, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
if the abdication of his father in his favour had been
executed earlier, it might have had the effect of saving
the kingdom from falling into the hands of the French
monarch. But it was now too late. A large portion
of it had already declared itself in favour of the
invaders. Ferdinand found the contest hopeless, and
early in 1495 retired to Ischia. Charles entered Naples
the 21st of February, 1495, and the whole kingdom
hastened to accept him as its sovereign.</p>

<p>Meantime, however, Ludovico, Duke of Milan,
whose oppressed nephew had died on the 22nd of
October, 1494, began to be alarmed at the too complete
success of his own policy, and entered into a league
with the Venetians, the King of the Romans, and
Ferdinand of Castile, against Charles, who seems to
have immediately become as much panic stricken at
the news of it as Alphonso had been at his approach.
The French, moreover, both the monarch and his
followers, had lost no time in making themselves so
odious to the Neapolitans, that the nation had already
repented of having abandoned Ferdinand so readily,
and were anxious to get rid of the French and receive
him back again. Towards the end of May, 1495,
Charles hastily left Naples on his return to France,
leaving Gilbert de Montpensier as Viceroy; and on
the 7th of July, Ferdinand returned to Naples and was
gladly welcomed by the people.</p>

<p>And now, having thus the good-will of his subjects
already disgusted with their French rulers, Ferdinand
might in all probability have succeeded without any
foreign assistance in ridding his country of the remaining
French troops left behind him by Charles, and in
re-establishing the dynasty of Arragon on the throne
of Naples, had he not at the time when things looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
worst with him, on the first coming of Charles, committed
the fatal error of asking assistance from Ferdinand
the Catholic, of Castile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RAPID CHANGES AT NAPLES.</div>

<p>Ferdinand the Catholic and the crafty, did not
wait to be asked a second time; but instantly despatched
to his aid, Consalvo Ernandez d'Aguilar, known thereafter
in Neapolitan history as "Il gran Capitano,"
both on account of his rank as Generalissimo of the
Spanish forces, and of his high military merit and
successes. Ferdinand of Arragon, with the help of
Consalvo and the troops he brought with him, soon
succeeded in driving the French out of his kingdom;
and appeared to be on the eve of a more prosperous
period when a sudden illness put an end to his life in
October, 1496. He died without offspring, and was
succeeded by his uncle Frederick.</p>

<p>Thus, as the Neapolitan historians remark, Naples
had passed under the sway of no less than five
monarchs in the space of three years: to wit&mdash;</p>

<p>Ferdinand of Arragon, the first, who died 25th of
January, 1494.</p>

<p>Alphonso, his son, who abdicated on the 3rd of
February, 1495.</p>

<p>Charles of France, crowned at Naples on the 20th
of May, 1495, and driven out of the kingdom immediately
afterwards.</p>

<p>Ferdinand of Arragon, II., son of Alphonso, who
entered Naples in triumph on the 7th of July, 1495,
and died in October, 1496.</p>

<p>Frederick of Arragon, his uncle, who succeeded him.</p>

<p>But these so rapid changes had not exhausted the
slides of Fortune's magic lanthorn. She had other
harlequinade transformations in hand, sufficient to
make even Naples tired of change and desirous of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
repose. Frederick, the last, and perhaps the best,
and best-loved of the Neapolitan sovereigns of the
dynasty of Arragon, reigned but to witness the final
discomfiture and downfall of his house.</p>

<p>Charles VIII. died in April, 1498; but his successor,
Louis XII., was equally anxious to possess himself of
the crown of Naples, and more able to carry his views
into effect. The principal obstacle to his doing so
was the power of Ferdinand of Spain, and the presence
of the Spanish troops under Consalvo in Naples.
Ferdinand the Catholic, could by no means permit the
spoliation of his kinsman and ally, Frederick, who
loyally relied on his protection, for the profit of the
King of France. Louis knew that it was impossible he
should do so. But the Most Christian King thought
that the Most Catholic King might very probably find
it consistent with kingly honour to take a different
view of the case, if it were proposed to him to go shares
in the plunder. And the Most Christian King's estimate
of royal nature was so just, that the Most Catholic
King acceded in the frankest manner to his royal
brother's proposal.</p>

<p>Louis accordingly sent an army to invade Naples in
the year 1500. The unfortunate Frederick was beguiled
the while into thinking that his full trust might be
placed on the assistance of Spain. But, when on the
25th of June, 1501, the Borgia Pope, Alexander VII.,
published a bull graciously dividing his dominions
between the two eldest sons of the Church, he perceived
at once that his position was hopeless. Resolving,
however, not to abandon his kingdom without making
an attempt to preserve it, he determined to defend himself
in Capua. That city was however taken by the
French on the 24th of July, 1501, and Frederick fled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
to Ischia; whence he subsequently retired to France,
and died at Tours on the 9th of November, 1504.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORTUNES OF NAPLES.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the royal accomplices having duly shared
their booty, instantly began to quarrel, as thieves are
wont to do, over the division of it. Each in fact had
from the first determined eventually to possess himself
of the whole; proving, that if indeed there be honour
among thieves, the proverb must not be understood to
apply to such as are "Most Christian," and "Most
Catholic."</p>

<p>Naples thus became the battle-field, as well as the
prize of the contending parties; and was torn to pieces
in the struggle while waiting to see which invader was
to be her master. At length the Spaniard proved the
stronger, as he was also the more iniquitous of the two;
and on the 1st of January, 1504, the French finally
quitted the kingdom of Naples, leaving it in the entire
and peaceful possession of Ferdinand of Spain. Under
him, and his successors on the Spanish throne, the
unhappy province was governed by a series of viceroys,
of whom, says Colletta,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> "one here and there was good,
many bad enough, and several execrable," for a period
of 230 years, with results still visible.</p>

<p>Such was the scene on which our heroine had to
enter in the year 1490. She was the daughter of
Fabrizio, brother of that protonotary Colonna, whose
miserable death at the hands of the hereditary enemies
of his family, the Orsini, allied with the Riarii, then
in power for the nonce during the popedom of Sixtus IV.,
has been related in the life of Caterina Sforza. Her
mother was Agnes of Montefeltre; and all the biographers
and historians tell us, that she was the youngest of six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
children born to her parents. The statement is a
curious instance of the extreme and very easily detected
inaccuracy, which may often be found handed on unchallenged
from one generation to another of Italian
writers of biography and history.</p>

<p>The Cavaliere Pietro Visconti, the latest Italian,
and by far the most complete of Vittoria's biographers,
who edited a handsome edition of her works, not published,
but printed in 1840 at the expense of the prince-banker,
Torlonia, on the occasion of his marriage with
the Princess Donna Teresa Colonna, writes thus at
page lv of the life prefixed to this votive volume:&mdash;"The
child (Vittoria) increased and completed the
number of children whom Agnes of Montefeltre,
daughter of Frederick, Duke of Urbino, had presented
to her husband." He adds, in a note, "this Princess
had already had five sons, Frederick, Ascanio,
Ferdinando, Camillo, Sciarra."</p>

<p>Coppi, in his "Memorie Colonnesi," makes no mention<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
of the last three,&mdash;giving as the offspring of
Fabrizio and Agnes, only Frederick, Ascanio, and
Vittoria. Led by this discrepancy to examine further
the accuracy of Visconti's statement, I found that
Agnes di Montefeltre was born in 1472; and was, consequently,
eighteen years old at the time of Vittoria's
birth. It became clear, therefore, that it was exceedingly
improbable, not to say impossible, that she should
have had five children previously. But I found farther,
that Frederick the eldest son, and always hitherto said
to have been the eldest child of Agnes, died according
to the testimony of his tombstone,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> still existing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Church of Santa Maria di Pallazzola, in the year 1516,
being then in his nineteenth year. He was, therefore,
born in 1497 or 1498, and must have been seven or
eight years younger than Vittoria; who must, it should
seem, have been the eldest and not the youngest of her
parent's children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HOUSE OF COLONNA.</div>

<p>It can scarcely be necessary to tell even the most
exclusively English reader, how ancient, how noble,
how magnificent, was the princely house of Colonna.
They were so noble, that their lawless violence, free-booting
habits, private wars, and clan enmities, rendered
them a scourge to their country; and for several
centuries contributed largely to the mass of anarchy
and barbarism, that rendered Rome one of the most
insecure places of abode in Europe, and still taints the
instincts of its populace with characteristics, which
make it one of the least civilisable races of Italy. The
Orsini being equally noble, and equally powerful and
lawless, the high-bred mastiffs of either princely house
for more than 200 years, with short respites of ill-kept
truce, never lost an opportunity of flying at each other's
throats, to the infinite annoyance and injury of their
less noble and more peaceably disposed fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>Though the possessions of the Colonna clan had
before been wide-spread and extensive, they received
considerable additions during the Papacy of the Colonna
pope, Martin V., great uncle of Fabrizio, Vittoria's
father, who occupied the Papal chair from 1417 to
1431. At the period of our heroine's birth the family
property was immense.</p>

<p>Very many were the fiefs held by the Colonna in the
immediate neighbourhood of the city, and especially
among the hills to the east and south-east of the
Campagna. There several of the strongest positions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
and most delightfully situated towns and castles,
belonged to them.</p>

<p>Among the more important of these was Marino,
admirably placed among the hills that surround the
lovely lake of Albano.</p>

<p>Few excursionists among the storied sites in the environs
of Rome make Marino the object of a pilgrimage.
The town has a bad name in these days. The Colonna
vassals who inhabit it, and still pay to the feudal lord
a tribute, recently ruled by the Roman tribunals to be
due (a suit having been instituted by the inhabitants
with a view of shaking off this old mark of vassalage),
are said to be eminent among the inhabitants of the
Campagna for violence, lawlessness, and dishonesty.
The bitterest hatred, the legacy of old wrong and
oppression, is felt by them against their feudal lords;
and this sentiment, which, inherited, as it seems to be,
from generation to generation, speaks but little in
favour of the old feudal rule, does not tend to make the
men of Marino good or safe subjects. Many a stranger
has, however, probably looked down from the beautifully
wooded heights of Castel Gandolfo on the picturesquely
gloomy little walled town creeping up the
steep side of its hill, and crowned by the ancient
seignorial residence it so much detests. And any one
of these would be able to assure a recent intensely
French biographer of Vittoria, that he is in error in
supposing that the town and castle of Marino have so
entirety perished and been forgotten, that the site of
them even is now unknown!<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PALIANO.</div>

<p>On the contrary the old castle has recently been
repaired and modernised into a very handsome nineteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
century residence to the no small injury of its
outward appearance in a picturesque and historical
point of view. The interior still contains unchanged
several of the nobly proportioned old halls, which were
planned at a time when mighty revels in the rare
times of peace, and defence in the more normal condition
of clan warfare, were the object held in view by
the builder. Many memorials of interest, moreover,
pictures, and other records of the old times were
brought to Marino from Paliano, when the Colonna
family were in the time of the last Pope, most unjustly
compelled to sell the latter possession to the Roman
government. Paliano, which from its mountain position
is extremely strong and easily defended, seemed to the
government of the Holy Father to be admirably adapted
to that prime want of a Papal despotism, a prison for
political offenders. The Colonnas, therefore, were invited
to sell it to the state; and on their declining to
do so, received an intimation, that the paternal government
having determined on possessing it, and having
also fixed the price they intended to give for it, no
option in the matter could be permitted them. So
Marino was enriched by all that was transferable of
the ancient memorials that had gathered around the
stronger mountain fortress in the course of centuries.</p>

<p>It was at Marino that Vittoria was born, in a rare
period of most unusually prolonged peace. Her parents
had selected, we are told, from among their numerous
castles, that beautiful spot for the enjoyment of the
short interval of tranquillity which smiled on their
first years<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> of marriage. A very successful raid, in
which Fabrizio and his cousin Prospero Colonna had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
harried the fiefs of the Orsini, and driven off a great
quantity of cattle,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> had been followed by a peace made
under the auspices of Innocent VIII. on the 11th
August, 1486, which seems absolutely to have lasted
till 1494, when we find the two cousins at open war
with the new Pope Alexander VI.</p>

<p>Far more important contests, however, were at hand,
the progress of which led to the youthful daughter of
the house being treated, while yet in her fifth year, as
part of the family capital, to be made use of for the
advancement of the family interests, and thus fixed the
destiny of her life.</p>

<p>When Charles VIII. passed through Rome on his
march against Naples at the end of 1494, the Colonna
cousins sided with him; placed themselves under his
banners, and contributed materially to aid his successful
invasion. But on his flight from Naples in 1495,
they suddenly changed sides, and took service under
Ferdinand II. The fact of this change of party, which
to our ideas seems to require so much explanation,
probably appeared to their contemporaries a perfectly
simple matter; for it is mentioned as such without any
word of the motives or causes of it. Perhaps they
merely sought to sever themselves from a losing game.
Possibly, as we find them rewarded for their adherence
to the King of Naples by the grant of a great number
of fiefs previously possessed by the Orsini, who were
on the other side, they were induced to change their
allegiance by the hope of obtaining those possessions,
and by the Colonna instinct of enmity to the Orsini
race. Ferdinand, however, was naturally anxious to
have some better hold over his new friends than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
furnished by their own oaths of fealty; and with this
view caused the infant Vittoria to be betrothed to his
subject, Ferdinand d'Avalos, son of Alphonso, Marquis
of Pescara, a child of about the same age as the
little bride.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER EARLY TRAINING.</div>

<p>Little, as it must appear to our modern notions, as
the child's future happiness could have been cared for
in the stipulation of a contract entered into from such
motives, it so turned out, that nothing could have more
effectually secured it. To Vittoria's parents, if any
doubts on such a point had presented themselves to
their minds, it would doubtless have appeared abundantly
sufficient to know, that the rank and position of
the affianced bridegroom were such, as to secure their
daughter one of the highest places among the nobility
of the court of Naples, and the enjoyment of vast and
wide-spread possessions. But to Vittoria herself all
this would not have been enough. And the earliest
and most important advantage arising to her from her
betrothal was the bringing her under the influence of
that training, which made her such a woman, as could
not find her happiness in such matters.</p>

<p>We are told, that henceforth, that is, after the
betrothal, she was educated, together with her future
husband, in the island of Ischia, under the care of the
widowed Duchessa di Francavilla, the young Pescara's
elder sister. Costanza d'Avalos, duchessa de Francavilla,
appears to have been one of the most remarkable
women of her time. When her father Alphonso,
Marchesa di Pescara, lost his life by the treason of a
black slave on the 7th of September, 1495, leaving
Ferdinand his son the heir to his titles and estates, an
infant five years old, then quite recently betrothed to
Vittoria, the Duchessa di Francavilla assumed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
entire direction and governance of the family. So
high was her reputation for prudence, energy, and
trust-worthiness in every way, that on the death of her
husband, King Ferdinand made her governor and
"châtelaine" of Ischia, one of the most important
keys of the kingdom. Nor were her gifts and qualities
only such as were calculated to fit her for holding such
a post. Her contemporary, Caterina Sforza, would
have made a "châtelaine" as vigilant, as prudent, as
brave and energetic as Costanza. But the Neapolitan
lady was something more than this.</p>

<p>Intellectual culture had been held in honour at
Naples during the entire period of the Arragonese
dynasty. All the princes of that house, with the
exception, perhaps, of Alphonso, the father of Ferdinand
II., had been lovers of literature and patrons of
learning. Of this Ferdinand II., under whose auspices
the young Pescara was betrothed to Vittoria, and who
chose the Duchessa di Francavilla as his governor in
Ischia, it is recorded, that when returning in triumph
to his kingdom after the retreat of the French, he rode
into Naples with the Marchese de Pescara on his right
hand, and the poet Cariteo on his left. Poets and
their art especially were welcomed in that literary
court; and the tastes and habits of the Neapolitan
nobles were at that period probably more tempered by
those studies, which humanise the mind and manners,
than the chivalry of any other part of Italy.</p>

<p>Among this cultured society Costanza d'Avalos was
eminent for culture, and admirably qualified in every
respect to make an invaluable protectress and friend
to her youthful sister-in-law. The transplantation,
indeed, of the infant Colonna from her native feudal
castle to the Duchessa di Francavilla's home in Ischia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
was a change so complete and so favourable, that it
may be fairly supposed, that without it the young
Roman girl would not have grown into the woman
she did.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER BETROTHAL.</div>

<p>For in truth Marino, little calculated, as it will be
supposed, such a stronghold of the ever turbulent
Colonna was at any time to afford the means and
opportunity for intellectual culture, became shortly
after the period of Vittoria's betrothal to the heir of
the D'Avalos, wholly unfit to offer her even a safe
home. Whether it continued to be the residence of
Agnes, while her husband Fabrizio was fighting in
Naples, and her daughter was under the care of the
Duchessa di Francavilla in Ischia, has not been recorded.
But we find that when Fabrizio had deserted
the French king, and ranged himself on the side of
Ferdinand of Naples, he was fully aware of the danger
to which his castles would be exposed at the hands of
the French troops as they passed through Rome on
their way to or from Naples. To provide against this,
he had essayed to place them in safety by consigning
them as a deposit in trust to the Sacred College.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> But
Pope Borgia, deeming, probably, that he might find
the means of possessing himself of some of the estates
in question, refused to permit this, ordering that they
should, instead, be delivered into his keeping. On this
being refused, he ordered Marino to be levelled to the
ground. And Guicciardini writes,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> that the Colonna,
having placed garrisons in Amelici and Rocca di Papa,
two other of the family strongholds, abandoned all the
rest of the possessions in the Roman States. It
seems probable, therefore, that Agnes accompanied her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
husband and daughter to Naples. Subsequently the same
historian relates,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> that Marino was burned by order of
Clement VII. in 1526. So that it must be supposed,
that the order of Alexander for its utter destruction in
1501 was not wholly carried into execution.</p>

<p>The kingdom and city of Naples was during this
time by no means without a large share of the turmoil
and warfare that was vexing every part of Italy. Yet
whosoever had his lot cast during those years elsewhere
than in Rome, was in some degree fortunate. And considering
the general state of the Peninsula, and her
own social position and connections, Vittoria may be
deemed very particularly so to have found a safe
retreat, and an admirably governed home on the rock
of Ischia. In after life we find her clinging to it with
tenacious affection, and dedicating more than one
sonnet to the remembrances which made it sacred to
her. And though in her widowhood her memory
naturally most frequently recurs to the happy years of
her married life there, the remote little island had at
least as strong a claim upon her affections as the home
of her childhood. For to the years there passed under
the care of her noble sister-in-law, Costanza d'Avalos,
she owed the possibility, that the daughter of a Roman
chieftain, who passed his life in harrying others and
being harried himself, and in acquiring as a "condottiere"
captain the reputation of one of the first
soldiers of his day, could become either morally or
intellectually the woman Vittoria Colonna became.</p>

<p class="pn p2">From the time of her betrothal in 1495 to that of
her marriage in 1509, history altogether loses sight of
Vittoria. We must suppose her to be quietly and
happily growing from infancy to adolescence under the
roof of Costanza d'Avalos, the <i>châtelaine</i> of Ischia,
sharing the studies of her future husband and present
playmate, and increasing, as in stature, so in every
grace both of mind and body. The young Pescara
seems also to have profited by the golden opportunities
offered him of becoming something better than a
mere <i>preux chevalier</i>. A taste for literature, and
especially for poesy, was then a ruling fashion among
the nobles of the court of Naples. And the young
Ferdinand, of whose personal beauty and knightly
accomplishments we hear much, manifested also excellent
qualities of disposition and intelligence. His
biographer Giovio<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> tells us that his beard was auburn,
his nose aquiline, his eyes large and fiery when
excited, but mild and gentle at other times. He was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
however, considered proud, adds Bishop Giovio, on
account of his haughty carriage, the little familiarity of
his manners, and his grave and brief fashion of speech.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER MARRIAGE.</div>

<p class="b1">To his playmate Vittoria, the companion of his
studies and hours of recreation, this sterner mood was
doubtless modified; and with all the good gifts attributed
to him, it was natural enough that before the
time had come for consummating the infant betrothal,
the union planned for political purposes had changed
itself into a veritable love-match. The affection seems
to have been equal on either side; and Vittoria, if we
are to believe the concurrent testimony of nearly all the
poets and literateurs of her day, must have been beautiful
and fascinating in no ordinary degree. The most
authentic portrait<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> of her is one preserved in the
Colonna gallery at Rome, supposed to be a copy by
Girolamo Muziano, from an original picture by some
artist of higher note. It is a beautiful face of the true
Roman type, perfectly regular, of exceeding purity of
outline, and perhaps a little heavy about the lower part
of the face. But the calm, large, thoughtful eye, and
the superbly developed forehead, secure it from any
approach towards an expression of sensualism. The
fulness of the lip is only sufficient to indicate that
sensitiveness to, and appreciation of beauty, which constitutes
an essential element in the poetical temperament.
The hair is of that bright golden tint that
Titian loved so well to paint; and its beauty has been
especially recorded by more than one of her contemporaries.
The poet Galeazzo da Tarsia, who professed
himself, after the fashion of the time, her most fervent
admirer and devoted slave, recurs in many passages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
his poems to those fascinating "chiome d'oro;" as
where he sings, with more enthusiasm than taste,
of the</p>

<p class="ppq20">
"Trecce d'or, che in gli alti giri,<br />
Non è ch'unqua pareggi o sole o stella;"</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">or again, where he tells us, that the sun and his lady-love
appeared</p>

<p class="ppn20">
"Ambi con chiome d'or lucide e terse."</p>

<p class="p1">But the testimony of graver writers, lay and clerical,
is not wanting to induce us to believe, that Vittoria in
her prime really might be considered "the most beautiful
woman of her day" with more truth than that
hackneyed phrase often conveys. So when at length
the Colonna seniors, and the Duchessa di Francavilla
thought, that the fitting moment had arrived for
carrying into effect the long-standing engagement&mdash;which
was not till 1509, when the <i>promessi sposi</i> were
both in their nineteenth year&mdash;the young couple were
thoroughly in love with each other, and went to the
altar with every prospect of wedded happiness.</p>

<p>But during these quiet years of study and development
in little rock-bound Ischia, the world without
was anything but quiet, as the outline of Neapolitan
history in the last chapter sufficiently indicates; and
Fabrizio Colonna was ever in the thick of the confusion.
As long as the Aragonese monarchs kept up the
struggle, he fought for them upon the losing side;
but when, after the retreat of Frederick, the last of
them, the contest was between the French and the
Spaniards, he chose the latter, which proved to be the
winning side. Frederick, on abandoning Naples, threw
himself on the hospitality of the King of France, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
enemy much less hated by him than was Ferdinand of
Spain, who had so shamefully deceived and betrayed
him. But his high Constable, Fabrizio Colonna, not
sharing, as it should seem, his sovereign's feelings on
the subject, transferred his allegiance to the King of
Spain. And again, this change of fealty and service
seems to have been considered so much in the usual
course of things, that it elicits no remark from the
contemporary writers.</p>

<p>In fact, the noble Fabrizio, the bearer of a grand
old Italian name, the lord of many a powerful barony,
and owner of many a mile of fair domain, a Roman
patrician of pure Italian race, to whom, if to any, the
honour, the independence, the interests, and the name
of Italy should have been dear, was a mere Captain of
free lances,&mdash;a soldier of fortune, ready to sell his
blood and great military talents in the best market.
The best of his fellow nobles in all parts of Italy were
the same. Their profession was fighting. And mere
fighting, in whatever cause, so it were bravely and
knightly done, was the most honoured and noblest profession
of that day. So much of real greatness as
could be imparted to the profession of war, by devotion
to a <i>person</i>, might occasionally&mdash;though not very
frequently in Italy&mdash;have been met with among the
soldiers of that period. But all those elements of
genuine heroism, which are generated by devotion to a
<i>cause</i>, and all those ideas of patriotism, of resistance to
wrong, and assertion of human rights, which compel
the philosopher and philanthropist to admit that war
may sometimes be righteous, noble, elevating, to those
engaged in it, and prolific of high thoughts and great
deeds, were wholly unknown to the chivalry of Italy at
the time in question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MEDIEVAL WARFARE.</div>

<p>And, indeed, as far as the feeling of nationality is concerned,
the institution of knighthood itself, as it then
existed, was calculated to prevent the growth of patriotic
sentiment. For the commonwealth of chivalry was of
European extent. The knights of England, France,
Italy, Spain, and Germany, were brothers in arms,
linked together by a community of thought and sentiment
infinitely stronger than any which bound them
to the other classes of their own countrymen. The
aggregation of caste wholly overbore that of nationality.
And the nature of the former, though not wholly evil
in its influences, any more than that of the latter is
wholly good, is yet infinitely narrower, less humanising,
and less ennobling in its action on human motives and
conduct. And war, the leading aggregative occupation
of those days, was proportionably narrowed in its scope,
deteriorated in its influences, and rendered incapable of
supplying that stimulus to healthy human development
which it has in its more noble forms, indisputably sometimes
furnished to mankind.</p>

<p>And it is important to the great history of modern
civilisation, that these truths should be recognised and
clearly understood. For this same period, which is
here in question, was, as all know, one of great intellectual
activity, of rapid development, and of fruitful
progress. And historical speculators on these facts,
finding this unusual movement of mind contemporaneous
with a time of almost universal and unceasing
warfare, have thought, that some of the producing
causes of the former fact were to be found in the
existence of the latter; and have argued, that the
general ferment, and stirring up, produced by these
chivalrous, but truly ignoble wars, assisted mainly in
generating that exceptionally fervid condition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
human mind. But, admitting that a time of national
struggle for some worthy object may probably be found
to exercise such an influence, as that attributed to the
Italian wars of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it
is certain that these latter were of no such ennobling
nature. And the causes of the great intellectual movement
of those centuries must therefore be sought
elsewhere.</p>

<p>From the time when "il gran Capitano" Consalvo,
on behalf of his master, Ferdinand of Spain, having
previously assisted the French in driving out the
unfortunate Frederick, the last of the Aragonese kings
of Naples, had afterwards finally succeeded in expelling
the French from their share of the stolen kingdom, the
affairs of the Colonna cousins, Fabrizio and Prospero,
began to brighten. The last French troops quitted
Naples on January 1, 1504. By a diploma, bearing
date November 15, 1504,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> and still preserved among
the Colonna archives, eighteen baronies were conferred
on Prospero Colonna by Ferdinand. On the 28th of
the same month, all the fiefs which Fabrizio had
formerly possessed in the Abruzzi were restored to him;
and by another deed, dated the same day, thirty-three
others, in the Abruzzi and the Terra di Lavoro, were
bestowed on him.</p>

<p>In the meantime, earth had been relieved from the
presence of the Borgia Vicegerent of heaven, and
Julius II. reigned in his stead. By him the Colonna
were relieved from their excommunication, and restored
to all their Roman possessions. So that the news of
the family fortunes, which from time to time reached
the daughter of the house in her happy retirement in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
rocky Ischia, from the period at which she began to be
of an age to appreciate the importance of such matters,
were altogether favourable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFFAIRS IN NAPLES.</div>

<p>But the tranquil life there during these years was not
unbroken by sympathy with the vicissitudes which were
variously affecting the excitable city, over which the
little recluse court looked from their island home. The
untimely death of Ferdinand II., on Friday, October 7,
1496, threw the first deep shade over the household
of the Duchessa di Francavilla, which had crossed it
since Vittoria had become its inmate. Never, according
to the contemporary journalist, Giuliano Passeri,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> was
prince more truly lamented by his people of every class.
Almost immediately after his marriage, the young king
and his wife both fell ill at Somma, near Naples. The
diarist describes the melancholy spectacle of the two
biers, supporting the sick king and queen, entering
their capital side by side. Everything that the science
of the time could suggest, even to the carrying in procession
of the head as well as the blood of St.
Januarius, was tried in vain. The young king, of
whom so much was hoped, died; and there arose
throughout the city, writes Passeri, "a cry of weeping
so great, that it seemed as if the whole world were
falling in ruin, all, both great and small, male and
female, crying aloud to heaven for pity. So that I
truly think, that since God made the world, a greater
weeping than this was never known."</p>

<p>Then came the great Jubilee year, 1500; on which
occasion a circumstance occurred, that set all Naples
talking. It was discussed, we may shrewdly conjecture,
in a somewhat different spirit in that Ischia household,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
which most interests us, from the tone in which the
excitable city chattered of it. At the beginning of
April,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> the Neapolitans, in honour of the great Jubilee,
sent a deputation, carrying with them the celebrated
Virgin, della Bruna dello Carmine, who justified her
reputation, and did credit to her country by working
innumerable miracles all the way as she went. But
what was the mortification of her bearers, when arrived
at Rome, the result of the fame arising from their
triumphant progress was, that Pope Borgia, jealous of
a foreign Virgin, which might divert the alms of the
faithful from the Roman begging boxes, showed himself
so thorough a protectionist of the home manufacture,
that he ordered the Neapolitan Virgin to be carried
back again immediately. This had to be done; but
Madonna della Bruna, nothing daunted, worked miracles
faster than ever as she was being carried off, and continued
to do so all the way home.</p>

<p>In July, 1501, there came a guest to the dwelling of
Costanza d'Avalos, whose coming and going must have
made a durable impression on the opening mind of
Vittoria, then just eleven years old. This was Frederick,
the last of the Aragonese kings. When all had gone
against him, and the French had taken, and most
cruelly sacked Capua, and were advancing on Naples,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
he sought refuge with his wife and children on the
Island of Ischia, and remained there till he left it on
the 6th of September to throw himself on the generosity
of the French King. Fabrizio Colonna was, it is
recorded, with him on the island, where the fallen king
left for awhile his wife and children; and had then an
opportunity of seeing,&mdash;as far as the brave <i>condottiere</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
chieftain had eyes to see such matters,&mdash;the progress
his daughter had made in all graces and good gifts
during six years of the superintendence of Costanza
d'Avalos.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FERDINAND LANDS IN NAPLES.</div>

<p>Then there came occasionally events, which doubtless
called the Duchessa di Francavilla from her retirement
to the neighbouring, but strongly contrasted scene of
Naples; and in all probability furnished opportunities
of showing her young pupil something of the great and
gay world of the brilliant and always noisy capital.
Such, for instance, was the entry of Ferdinand of Spain
into Naples, on November I, 1506. The same people,
who so recently were making the greatest lamentation
ever heard in the world over the death of Ferdinand of
Aragon, were now equally loud and vehement<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> in
their welcome to his false usurping kinsman, Ferdinand
of Castile. A pier was run out an hundred paces into
the sea for him and his queen to land at, and a tabernacle,
"all of fine wrought gold," says Passeri, erected
on it for him to rest in. The city wall was thrown
down to make a new passage for his entrance into the
city; all Naples was gay with triumphal arches and
hangings. The mole, writes the same gossiping
authority, was so crowded, that a grain of millet
thrown among them would not have reached the
ground. Nothing was to be heard in all Naples but
the thunder of cannon, and nothing to be seen but
velvet, silk, and brocade, and gold on all sides. The
streets were lined with richly tapestried seats, filled
with all the noble dames of Naples, who, as the royal
cortege passed, rose, and advancing, kissed the hands
of the king, "et lo signore Re di questo si pigliava<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
gran piacere." It is a characteristic incident of the
times, that as quick as the cortege passed, all the rich
and costly preparations for its passage were, as Passeri
tells us, scrambled for and made booty of by the
populace.</p>

<p>The Duchessa di Francavilla, at least, who had
witnessed the melancholy departure of Frederick from
her own roof, when he went forth a wanderer from his
lost kingdom, must have felt the hollowness and little
worth of all this noisy demonstration, if none other
among the assembled crowd felt it. And it may easily
be imagined how she moralised the scene to the lovely
blonde girl at her side, now at sixteen, in the first
bloom of her beauty, as they returned, tired with the
unwonted fatigue of their gala doings, to their quiet
home in Ischia.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen from the pages of the gossiping
weaver,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> of the sort of subjects which were the talk of
the day in Naples in those times.</p>

<p>In December, 1507, a certain Spaniard, Pietro de
Pace, by name, a hunchback, and much deformed, but
who "was of high courage, and in terrestrial matters
had no fear of spirits or of venomous animals,"
determined to explore the caverns of Pozzuoli; and
discovered in them several bronze statues and medals,
and antique lamps. He found also some remains of
leaden pipes, on one of which the words "Imperator
Cæsar" were legible. Moreover, he saw "certain lizards
as large as vipers." But for all this, Pietro considered
his adventure an unsuccessful one; for he had hoped to
find hidden treasure in the caverns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRE AT ST. CLARE.</div>

<p>Then there was barely time for this nine days' wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
to run out its natural span, before a very much more
serious matter was occupying every mind, and making
every tongue wag in Naples. On the night preceding
Christmas day, in the year 1507, the Convent of St.
Clare was discovered to be on fire. The building was
destroyed, and the nuns, belonging mostly to noble
Neapolitan families, were burnt out of their holy home;&mdash;distressing
enough on many accounts. But still it
was not altogether the misfortune of these holy ladies
that spread consternation throughout the city. It was
the practice, it seems, for a great number of the
possessors of valuables of all sorts, "Baruni od altri,"
as Passeri says,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> in his homely Neapolitan dialect,
to provide against the continual dangers to which
moveable property was exposed, by consigning their
goods to the keeping of some religious community.
And the nuns of St. Clare, especially, were very largely
employed in this way. The consequence was, that
the almost incredibly large amount of three hundred
thousand ducats worth of valuable articles of all sorts
was destroyed in this disastrous fire. Taking into consideration
the difference in the value of money, this
sum must be calculated to represent at least a million
and a half sterling of our money. And it is necessary
to bear in mind how large a proportion of a rich man's
wealth in those days consisted in chattels to render
the estimate of the loss at all credible.</p>

<p>The prices, however, at which certain of the products
of artistic industry were then estimated, were such as
to render such an accumulation of property possible
enough. For instance, among the valuables recorded
by Passeri as belonging to Ferdinand of Aragon I.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
were three pieces of tapestry, which were called "La
Pastorella," and were considered to be worth 130,000
ducats.</p>

<p>And thus the years rolled on; Naples gradually
settling down into tranquillity under the Spanish rule,
administered by the first of the long list of viceroys,
the "Gran Capitano," Don Consalvo de Corduba, and
the star of the Colonna shining more steadily than ever
in the ascendant, till in the year 1509, the nineteenth
of Vittoria's and of the bridegroom's age, it was determined
to celebrate the long arranged marriage.</p>

<p>It took place on the 27th of December in that year;
and Passeri mentions,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> that Vittoria came to Ischia
from Marino on the occasion, escorted by a large company
of Roman nobles. It appears, therefore, that she
must have quitted Ischia previously. But it is probable
that she did so only for a short visit to her
native home, before finally settling in her husband's
country.</p>

<p>The marriage festival was held in Ischia with all the
pomp then usual on such occasions; and that, as will
be seen in a subsequent page, from the accounts preserved
by Passeri of another wedding, at which Vittoria
was present, was a serious matter. The only particulars
recorded for us of her own marriage ceremony
consist of two lists of the presents reciprocally made
by the bride and bridegroom. These have been printed
from the original documents in the Colonna archives
by Signor Visconti, and are curious illustrations of the
habits and manners of that day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER TROUSSEAU.</div>

<p>The Marquis acknowledges to have received, says
the document, from the Lord Fabrizio Colonna and
the Lady Vittoria,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>1. A bed of French fashion, with the curtains and
all the hangings of crimson satin, lined with blue
taffetas with large fringes of gold; with three mattresses
and a counterpane of crimson satin of similar
workmanship; and four pillows of crimson satin garnished
with fringes and tassels of gold.</p>

<p>2. A cloak of crimson raised brocade.</p>

<p>3. A cloak of black raised brocade, and white silk.</p>

<p>4. A cloak of purple velvet and purple brocade.</p>

<p>5. A cross of diamonds and a housing for a mule of
wrought gold.</p>

<p class="pn">The other document sets forth the presents offered
by Pescara to his bride:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A cross of diamonds with a chain of gold of the
value of 1000 ducats.</p>

<p>2. A ruby, a diamond, and an emerald set in gold, of
the value of 400 ducats.</p>

<p>3. A "desciorgh" of gold (whatever that may be) of
the value of 100 ducats.</p>

<p>4. Twelve bracelets of gold, of the value of 40
ducats.</p>

<p>Then follow fifteen articles of female dress, gowns,
petticoats, mantles, skirts, and various other finery
with strange names, only to be explained by the ghost
of some sixteenth century milliner, and altogether
ignored by Ducange, and all other lexicographers.
But they are described as composed of satin, velvet,
brocade; besides crimson velvet trimmed with gold
fringe, and lined with ermine; and flesh-coloured silk
petticoats, trimmed with black velvet. The favourite
colour appears to be decidedly crimson.</p>

<p>It is noticeable, that while all the more valuable
presents of Pescara to Vittoria are priced, nothing is
said of the value of her gifts to the bridegroom. Are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>

feeling on the part of the lady?</p>

<p>So the priests did their office&mdash;a part of the celebration,
which, curiously enough, we learn from
Passeri, was often in those days at Naples, deferred,
sometimes for years, till after the consummation of the
marriage&mdash;the Pantagruelian feastings were got through,
the guests departed, boat-load after boat-load, from the
rocky shore of Ischia; and the little island, restored
after the unusual hubbub to its wonted quiet, was left
to be the scene of as happy a honeymoon as the most
romantic of novel readers could wish for her favourite
heroine.</p>

Cruelty&mdash;Anecdote in Proof of it.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The two years which followed, Vittoria always
looked back on as the only truly happy portion of her
life, and many are the passages of her poems which
recall their tranquil and unbroken felicity, a sweet
dream, from which she was too soon to be awakened to
the ordinary vicissitudes of sixteenth century life.
The happiest years of individuals, as of nations, afford
least materials for history, and of Vittoria's two years
of honeymoon in Ischia, the whole record is that she
was happy; and she wrote no poetry.</p>

<p>Early in 1512 came the waking from this pleasant
dream. Pescara was, of course, to be a soldier. In
his position not to have begun to fight, as soon as his
beard was fairly grown, would have been little short of
infamy. So he set forth to join the army in Lombardy,
in company with his father-in-law, Fabrizio. Of course
there was an army in Lombardy, where towns were
being besieged, fields laid waste, and glory to be had for
the winning. There always was, in those good old times
of course. French, Swiss, Spanish, German, Venetian,
Papal, and Milanese troops were fighting each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
with changes of alliances and sides almost as frequent
and as confusing as the changing of partners in a
cotillion. It is troublesome and not of much consequence
to understand who were just then friends and
who foes, and what were the exact objects all the different
parties had in cutting each other's throats. And
it will be quite sufficient to say that the Duchy of
Milan was at that moment the chief bone of contention,&mdash;that
the principal pretenders to the glory of "annexing"
it were the King of France and the King of
Spain, who was now also King of Naples&mdash;that the
Pope was just then allied with Spain, and the Venetians
with France, and that Italy generally was preparing
for the destiny she has worked out for herself,
by the constant endeavour to avail herself of the
destroying presence of these foreign troops, and their
rivalries, for the prosecution of her internal quarrels,
and the attainment of equally low and yet more unjustifiable,
because fratricidal aims.</p>

<p>Pescara, as a Neapolitan subject of the King of
Spain, joined the army opposed to the French, under
the walls of Ravenna. Vittoria, though her subsequent
writings prove how much the parting cost her, showed
how thoroughly she was a soldier's daughter and a
soldier's wife. There had been some suggestion, it
seems, that the marquis, as the sole surviving scion of
an ancient and noble name, might fairly consider it
his duty not to subject it to the risk of extinction by
exposing his life in the field. The young soldier,
however, wholly refused to listen to such counsels;
and his wife strongly supported his view of the course
honour counselled him to follow, by advice, which a
young and beautiful wife, who was to remain surrounded
by a brilliant circle of wits and poets, would scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
have ventured on offering, had she not felt a perfect
security from all danger of being misinterpreted,
equally creditable to wife and husband.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PESCARA JOINS THE ARMY.</div>

<p>So the young soldier took for a motto on his shield,
the well-known "With this, or on this;" and having
expended, we are told, much care and cash on a magnificent
equipment, was at once appointed to the
command of the light cavalry. The knowledge and
experience necessary for such a position comes by
nature, it must be supposed, to the descendant of a
long line of noble knights, as surely as pointing does
to the scion of a race of pointers. But the young
warrior's episcopal<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> biographer cursorily mentions,
that certain old and trusty veterans, who had obtained
their military science by experience, and not by right
of birth, were attached to his person.</p>

<p>The general of light cavalry arrived at the camp at
an unfortunate moment. The total defeat of the
United Spanish and Papal army by the French before
Ravenna on the 9th of April, 1512, immediately followed.
Fabrizio Colonna and his son-in-law were both
made prisoners. The latter had been left for dead on
the field, covered with wounds, which subsequently
gave occasion to Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan,
to say, "I would fain be a man, Signor Marchese, if it
were only to receive such wounds as yours in the face,
that I might see if they would become me as they
do you."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Pescara, when picked up from the field, was carried
a prisoner to Milan, where, by means of the good offices
and powerful influence of Trivulzio, who had married
Beatrice d'Avalos, Pescara's aunt, and was now a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
general in the service of France, his detention was
rendered as little disagreeable as possible, and he was,
as soon as his wounds were healed, permitted to ransom
himself for six thousand ducats.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>During his short confinement he amused his leisure
by composing a "Dialogo d'Amore," which he inscribed
and sent to his wife. The Bishop of Como,
his biographer, testifies that this work was exceedingly
pleasant reading&mdash;"summæ jucunditatis"&mdash;and full of
grave and witty conceits and thoughts. The world,
however, has seen fit to allow this treasury of wit to
perish, notwithstanding the episcopal criticism. And
in all probability the world was in the right. If,
indeed, the literary general of light horse had written
his own real thoughts and speculations on love, there
might have been some interest in seeing a sixteenth
century soldier's views on that ever interesting subject.
But we may be quite certain, that the Dialogo,
"stuffed full," as Giovio says, "of grave sentiments
and exquisite conceits," contained only a reproduction
of the classic banalities, and ingenious absurdities,
which were current in the fashionable literature of the
day. Yet it must be admitted, that the employment
of his leisure in any such manner, and still more, the
dedication of his labours on such a subject to his
wife, are indications of an amount of cultivation
and right feeling, which would hardly have been found,
either one or the other, among many of the preux
chevaliers, his brothers-in-arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EPISTLE TO HER HUSBAND.</div>

<p class="b1">Meanwhile, Vittoria, on her part, wrote a poetical
epistle to her husband in prison, which is the first
production of her pen that has reached us. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
written in Dante's "terza rima," and consists of 112
lines. Both Italian and French critics have expressed
highly favourable judgments of this little poem. And
it may be admitted that the lines are elegant, classical,
well-turned, and ingenious. But those who seek
something more than all this in poetry&mdash;who look for
passion, high and noble thoughts, happy illustration
or deep analysis of human feeling, will find nothing
of the sort. That Vittoria did feel acutely her husband's
misfortune, and bitterly regret his absence from
her, there is every reason to believe. But she is unable
to express these sentiments naturally or forcibly. She,
in all probability made no attempt to do so, judging
from the models on which she had been taught to form
her style, that when she sat down to make poetry, the
aim to be kept in view was a very different one. Hence
we have talk of Hector and Achilles, Eolus, Sirens, and
marine deities, Pompey, Cornelia, Cato, Martia, and
Mithridates&mdash;a parade of all the treasures of the
schoolroom. The pangs of the wife left lonely in her
home are in neatly antithetical phrase contrasted with
the dangers and toils of the husband in the field.
Then we have a punning allusion to her own name:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq20">
"Se Vittoria volevi, io t'era appresso;<br />
Ma tu, lasciando me, lasciasti lei."</p>

<p>"If victory was thy desire, I was by thy side; but
in leaving me, thou didst leave also her."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">The best, because the simplest and most natural
lines are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq20">
"Seguir si deve il sposo e dentro e fora;<br />
E, s'egli pate affanno, ella patisca;<br />
Se lieto, lieta; e se vi more, mora.<br />
A quel che arrisca l'un, l'altro s'arrisca;<br />
Eguali in vita, eguali siano in morte;<br />
E ciò che avviene a lui, a lei sortisca."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">"At home or abroad the wife should follow her
husband; and if he suffers distress, she should suffer;
should be joyful if he is joyful, and should die if he
dies. The danger confronted by the one should be
confronted by the other; equals in life, they should be
equal in death; and that which happens to him should
be her lot also,"&mdash;a mere farrago of rhetorical prettinesses,
as cold as a school-boy's prize verses, and unanimated
by a spark of genuine feeling; although the
writer was as truly affectionate a wife as ever man had.</p>

<p>But, although all that Vittoria wrote, and all that the
vast number of the poets and poetesses, her contemporaries,
wrote, was obnoxious to the same remarks; still
it will be seen, that in the maturity of her powers she
could do better than this. Her religious poetry may
be said, generally, to be much superior to her love
verses; either because they were composed when her
mind had grown to its full stature, or, as seems probable,
because, model wife as she was, the subject took
a deeper hold of her mind, and stirred the depths of
her heart more powerfully.</p>

<p>Very shortly after the despatch of her poetical
epistle, Vittoria was overjoyed by the unexpected return
of her husband. And again for a brief interval she
considered herself the happiest of women.</p>

<p>One circumstance indeed there was to mar the
entirety of her contentment. She was still childless.
And it seems, that the science of that day, ignorantly
dogmatical, undertook to assert, that she would continue
to be so. Both husband and wife seem to have submitted
to the award undoubtingly; and the dictum,
however rashly uttered, was justified by the event.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARCHESE DEL VASTO.</div>

<p>Under these circumstances, Vittoria undertook the
education of Alphonso d'Avalos, Marchese del Vasto, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
young cousin of her husband's. The task was a sufficiently
arduous one;<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> for the boy, beautiful, it is
recorded, as an angel, and endowed with excellent
capabilities of all sorts, was so wholly unbroken, and
of so violent and ungovernable a disposition, that he
had been the despair and terror of all who had hitherto
attempted to educate him. Vittoria thought that she
saw in the wild and passionate boy the materials of a
worthy man. The event fully justified her judgment,
and proved the really superior powers of mind she
must have brought to the accomplishment of it.
Alphonso became a soldier of renown, not untinctured
by those literary tastes which so remarkably distinguished
his gentle preceptress. A strong and lasting
affection grew between them; and Vittoria, proud with
good reason of her work, was often wont to say, that
the reproach of being childless ought not to be deemed
applicable to her whose moral nature might well be
said to have brought forth that of her pupil.</p>

<p>Pescara's visit to Naples was a very short one.
Early in 1513, we find him again with the armies in
Lombardy, taking part in most of the mischief and
glory going.</p>

<p>Under the date of July the 4th in that year, the
gossiping Naples weaver, who rarely fails to note the
doings of the Neapolitan General of light horse with
infinite pride and admiration, has preserved for us a
rather picturesque little bit of Ariosto-flavoured camp
life. The Spanish army, under Don Raymond di
Cardona, who, on Consalvo's death had succeeded him
as Viceroy of Naples, was on its march from Peshiera
to Verona, when a messenger from the beautiful young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Marchioness of Mantua came to the General-in-chief
to say that she wished to see those celebrated Spanish
troops, who were marching under his banners, and was
then waiting their passage in the vineyards of the Castle
of Villafranca. "A certain gentle lady of Mantua,
named the Signora Laura, with whom Don Raymond
was in love," writes the weaver, was with the Marchioness;
and much pleased was he at the message.
So word was passed to the various captains; and when
the column reached the spot, where the Marchioness
with a great number of ladies and cavaliers of Mantua
were reposing in the shade of the vines, "Don Ferrante
d'Alarcone, as Chief Marshal, with his bâton in his
hand made all the troops halt, and place themselves in
order of battle; and the Signor Marchese di Pescara
marched at the head of the infantry, with a pair of
breeches cut after the Swiss fashion, and a plume on
his head, and a two-handed sword in his hand, and all
the standards were unfurled." And when the Marchioness
from among the vines looking down through
the chequered shade on to the road saw that all was in
order, she and her ladies got into three carts, so that
there came out of the vineyard, says Passeri, three
cartsful of ladies surrounded by the cavaliers of
Mantua on horseback. There they came very slowly
jolting over the cultivated ground, those three heavy
bullock carts, with their primitive wheels of one solid
circular piece of wood, and their huge cream-coloured
oxen with enormous horned heads gaily decorated, as
Leopold Robert shows them to us, and the brilliant
tinted dresses of the laughing bevy drawn by them,
glancing gaudily in the sunlight among the soberer
colouring of the vineyards in their summer pride of
green. Then Don Raymond and Pescara advanced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
the carts, and handed from them the Marchioness and
Donna Laura, who mounted on handsomely equipped
jennets prepared for them. It does not appear that
this attention was extended to any of the other ladies,
who must therefore be supposed to have remained
sitting in the carts, while the Marchioness and the
favoured Donna Laura rode through the ranks "con
multa festa et gloria." And when she had seen all,
with much pleasure and admiration, on a given signal
three mules loaded with sweetmeats were led forward,
with which the gay Marchioness "regaled all the
captains." Then all the company with much content,&mdash;excepting,
it is to be feared, the soldiers, who had to
stand at arms under the July sun, while their officers
were eating sugar-plums, and Don Raymond and Donna
Laura were saying and swallowing sweet things,&mdash;took
leave of each other, the army pursuing its march towards
Verona, and the Marchioness and her ladies
returning in their carts to Mantua.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A REVIEW.</div>

<p>The other scattered notices of Pescara's doings
during his campaign are of a less festive character.
They show him to have been a hard and cruel man,
reckless of human suffering, and eminent even among
his fellow captains for the ferocity, and often wantonness
of the ravages and wide-spread misery he wrought.
On more than one occasion, Passeri winds up his narrative
of some destruction of a town, or desolation of a
fertile and cultivated district, by the remark, that the
cruelty committed was worse than Turks would have
been guilty of. Yet this same Passeri, an artisan,
belonging to a class which had all to suffer and nothing
to gain from such atrocities, writes, when chronicling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
this same Pescara's<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> death, that "on that day died,
I would have you know, gentle readers, the most
glorious and honoured captain that the world has seen
for the last hundred years." It is curious to observe
how wholly the popular mind was enslaved to the prejudices
and conventional absurdities of the ruling
classes; how entirely the feelings of the masses were
in unison with those of the caste which oppressed
them; how little reason they conceived they had to
complain under the most intolerable treatment, and
how little hope of progressive amelioration there was
from the action of native-bred public opinion.</p>

<p>Bishop Giovio, the biographer and panegyrist of
Pescara admits, that he was a stern and cruelly-severe
disciplinarian; and mentions an anecdote in proof of
it. A soldier was brought before him for having
entered a house <i>en route</i> for the purpose of plundering.
The General ordered that his ears should be cut off.
The culprit remonstrated; and begged, with many
entreaties, to be spared so dishonouring and ignominious
a punishment, saying in his distress that death
itself would have been more tolerable.</p>

<p>"The grace demanded is granted," rejoined Pescara
instantly, with grim pleasantry. "Take this soldier,
who is so careful of his honour, and hang him to that
tree!"</p>

<p>In vain did the wretch beg not to be taken at his
word so cruelly, no entreaties sufficed to change the
savage decree.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PESCARA'S CHARACTER.</div>

<p>It will be well that we should bear in mind these
indications of the essential nature of this great and
glorious captain, who had studied those ingenuous arts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
which soften the character, and do not suffer men to be
ferocious, as the poet assures us, and who could write
dialogues on love, when we come to consider the
curious phenomenon of Vittoria's unmeasured love
for her husband.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Meanwhile, Vittoria continued her peaceful and
quiet life in Ischia, lonely indeed, as far as the dearest
affections of her heart were concerned, but cheered
and improved by the society of that select knot of
poets and men of learning, whom Costanza di Francavilla,
not unassisted by the presence of Vittoria,
attracted to her little island court. We find Musefilo,
Filocalo, Giovio, Minturno, Cariteo, Rota, Sanazzaro,
and Bernardo Tasso, among those who helped to make
this remote rock celebrated throughout Europe at that
day, as one of the best loved haunts of Apollo and the
Muses,&mdash;to speak in the phraseology of the time.</p>

<p>Many among them have left passages recording the
happy days spent on that fortunate island. The social
circle was doubtless a charming and brilliant one, and
the more so, as contrasted with the general tone and
habits of the society of the period. But the style of
the following sonnet by Bernardo Tasso, selected by
Visconti as a specimen of the various effusions by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
members of the select circle upon the subject, while it
accurately illustrates the prevailing modes of thought
and diction of that period, will hardly fail to suggest
the idea of a comparison&mdash;mutatis mutandis&mdash;between
this company of sixteenth century choice spirits, and
that which assembled, and provoked so severe a lashing
in the memorable Hôtel de Rambouillet, more than an
hundred years afterwards. But an Italian Molière is
as wholly impossible in the nature of things, as a
French Dante. And the sixteenth century swarm of
Petrarchists and Classicists have, unlike true prophets,
found honour in their own country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BERNARDO TASSO.</div>

<p class="b1">Gentle Bernardo celebrates in this wise these famed
Ischia meetings:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"Superbo scoglio, altero e bel ricetto<br />
Di tanti chiari eroi, d'imperadori,<br />
Onde raggi di gloria escono fuori,</p>
<p class="psi20">Ch'ogni altro lume fan scuro e negletto;</p>
<p class="psq20">Se per vera virtute al ben perfetto<br />
Salir si puote ed agli eterni onori,<br />

<p class="psq20">V'andran, che chiudi nel petroso petto.</p>
<p class="psi20">Il lume e in te dell'armi; in te s'asconde<br />
Casta beltà, valore e cortesia,<br />
Quanta mai vide il tempo, o diede il cielo.</p>
<p class="psi20">Ti sian secondi i fati, e il vento e l'onde<br />
Rendanti onore, e l'aria tua natia<br />
Abbia sempre temprato il caldo e il gelo!"</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Which may be thus "done into English," for the
sake of giving those unacquainted with the language of
the original, some tolerably accurate idea of Messer
Bernardo's euphuisms.</p>

<p class="psq20">"Proud rock! the loved retreat of such a band<br />
Of earth's best, noblest, greatest, that their light<br />
Pales other glories to the dazzled sight,</p>
<p class="psi20">And like a beacon shines throughout the land,</p>
<p class="psq20"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>If truest worth can reach the perfect state,<br />
And man may hope to merit heavenly rest,<br />
Those whom thou harbourest in thy rocky breast,</p>
<p class="psq20">First in the race will reach the heavenly gate.</p>
<p class="psi20">Glory of martial deeds is thine. In thee,<br />
Brightest the world e'er saw, or heaven gave,</p>
<p class="psi20">Dwell chastest beauty, worth, and courtesy!</p>
<p class="psi20">Well be it with thee! May both wind and sea<br />
Respect thee: and thy native air and wave<br />
Be temper'd ever by a genial sky!"</p>

<p class="p1">Such is the poetry of one of the brightest stars of
the Ischian galaxy; and the incredulous reader is
assured that it would be easy to find much worse
sonnets by the ream, among the extant productions
of the crowd, who were afflicted with the prevalent
Petrarch mania of that epoch. The statistical returns
of the ravages of this malady, given by the poetical
registrar-general Crescimbeni, would astonish even
Paternoster Row at the present day. But Vittoria
Colonna, though a great number of her sonnets do not
rise above the level of Bernardo Tasso in the foregoing
specimen, could occasionally, especially in her later
years, reach a much higher tone, as will, it is hoped,
be shown in a future chapter.</p>

<p>It has been suggested, that the religious feelings
which inspired her latter poetry, were, though not
more genuine, yet more absorbing than the conjugal
love, which is almost exclusively the theme of her
earlier efforts. And it is at all events certain, that the
former so engrossed her whole mind, as to sever her in
a great measure from the world. This the so fervently
sung pangs of separation from her husband do not
appear to have effected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MARRIAGE IN 1517.</div>

<p>Besides the constant society of the select few, of
whom mention has been made, there were occasionally
gayer doings in Ischia; as when in February, 1517, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
brilliant festival was held there on occasion of the
marriage<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> of Don Alfonso Piccolomini with Costanza
d'Avalos, the sister of Vittoria's pupil, the Marchese
del Vasto. And occasionally the gentle poetess, necessitated
probably by the exigences of her social position,
would leave her beloved Ischia for brilliant and noisy
Naples. And when these necessities did occur, it is
recorded, that the magnificence and pomp, with which
the beautiful young wife made her appearance among
her fellow nobles, was such, as few of them could equal,
and none surpass.</p>

<p>One of these occasions is worth specially noting,
for the sake of the detailed account, which has
been preserved of it by that humble and observant
chronicler, our friend the weaver. For it contains
traits and indications, curiously and amusingly illustrative
of the life and manners of that time in
Naples.</p>

<p>It was December 6, 1517, and high festival was to
be held for the marriage of the King of Poland with
Donna Bona Sforza. The guests comprised the whole
nobility of Naples; and worthy Passeri begins his
account with an accurate Morning-Post-like statement
of the costume of each in the order of their arrival at
the church. Doubtless the eager weaver, a shrewd
judge of such matters, had pushed himself into a good
place in the front row of the crowd, who lined the roadway
of the noble guests, and might have been seen
with tablets in hand, taking notes with busy excitement
to be transferred to his journal at night. One after
another the high-sounding titles, very many of them
Spanish, are set forth, as they swept by, brilliant with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
gold and every brightest tint of costly fabric, and are
swallowed up by the dark nave of the huge church.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to attempt a translation of all the
changes Master Passeri rings on velvet, satin, gold,
brocade, and costly furs. Merely noting that the
bride's dress is estimated to be worth seven thousand
ducats, we let them all pass on till "The illustrious
lady the Signora Vittoria, Marchioness of Pescara,"
arrives. She is mounted on a black and white jennet,
with housings of crimson velvet, fringed with gold.
She is accompanied by six ladies in waiting, uniformly
clad in azure damask, and attended by six grooms on
foot, with cloaks and jerkins of blue and yellow satin.
The lady herself wears a robe of brocaded crimson
velvet, with large branches of beaten gold on it. She
has a crimson satin cap, with a head-dress of wrought
gold above it; and around her waist is a girdle of
beaten gold.</p>

<p>Some of the assembled company, one might think,
would require their girdles to be of some more yielding
material. For, on quitting the church, they sat down
to table at six in the evening, "and began to eat," says
Passeri, "and left off at five in the morning!" The
order and materials of this more than Homeric feast,
are handed down to posterity with scrupulous accuracy
by our chronicler. But the stupendous menu, in its
entirety, would be almost as intolerable to the reader,
as having to sit out the eleven hours orgy in person.
A few particulars culled here and there, partly because
they are curious, and partly because the meaning of
the words is more intelligible than is the case in many
instances, even to a Neapolitan of the present day,
will amply suffice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FESTIVAL.</div>

<p>There were twenty-seven courses. Then the quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
of sugar used, was made, as we have noticed on a former
occasion at Rome, a special subject of glorification.
There was "putaggio Ungarese," Hungary soup, stuffed
peacocks, quince pies, and thrushes served with bergamottes,
which were not pears, as an English reader
might perhaps suppose, but small highly scented
citrons, of the kind, from which the perfume of that
name is, or is supposed, to be made. With the
"bianco mangiare," our familiarity with "blanc-mange,"
seems at first sight to make us more at home. But we
are thrown out by finding, that it was eaten in 1517,
"con mostarda." The dishes of pastry seem according
to our habits, much out of proportion to the rest.
Sweet preparations also, whether of animal or vegetable
composition, seem greatly to preponderate. At
the queen's own table, a fountain gave forth odoriferous
waters. But, to all the guests, perfumed water for the
hands was served at the removal of the first tables.</p>

<p>"And thus having passed this first day with infinite
delight," the whole party passed a second, and a third,
in the same manner!</p>

<p>That eleven hours should have been spent in eating
and drinking is of course simply impossible. Large
interludes must be supposed to have been occupied by
music, and very likely by recitations of poetry. On
the first day a considerable time must have been taken
up by a part of the ceremonial, which was doubtless
far more interesting to the fairer half of the assembly
than the endless gormandising. This was a display,
article by article, of the bride's trousseau, which took
place while the guests were still sitting at table.
Passeri minutely catalogues the whole exhibition.
The list begins with twenty pairs of sheets, all
embroidered with different coloured silks; and seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
pairs of sheets, "d'olanda," of Dutch linen, fringed
with gold. Then come an hundred and five shirts
of Dutch linen, all embroidered with silk of divers
colours; and seventeen shirts of cambric, "cambraia,"
with a selvage of gold, as a present for the royal
bridegroom. There were twelve head-dresses, and six
ditto, ornamented with gold and coloured silk, for
his majesty; an hundred and twenty handkerchiefs,
embroidered with gold cord; ninety-six caps, ornamented
with gold and silk, of which thirty-six were
for the king. There were eighteen counterpanes of
silk, one of which was wrought "alla moresca;" forty-eight
sets of stamped leather hangings, thirty-six
others "of the ostrich egg pattern," sixteen "of the
artichoke pattern," and thirty-six of silk tapestry.
Beside all these hundred sets, there were eight large
pieces of Flanders arras, "con seta assai." They represented
the seven works of mercy, and were valued at a
thousand golden ducats. There was a litter, carved and
gilt, with its four mattrasses of blue embroidered satin.
Passing on to the plate department, we have a silver
waiter, two large pitchers wrought in relief, three
basins, an ewer, and six large cups, twelve large plates,
twelve ditto of second size, and twenty-four soup-plates
made "alla franzese," a massive salt-cellar, a box of
napkins, spoons, and jugs, four large candlesticks, two
large flasks, a silver pail, and a cup of gold worth two
hundred ducats for the king's use. Then for the chapel,
a furniture for the altar, with the history of the three
kings embroidered in gold on black velvet; a missal
on parchment, with illuminated miniatures, bound in
velvet ornamented with silver clasps and bosses; and
a complete set of requisites for the service in silver.
Then, returning to the personal department, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
twenty-one gowns, each minutely described, and one of
blue satin spangled with bees in solid gold, particularly
specified as being worth four thousand ducats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEES PESCARA FOR THE LAST TIME.</div>

<p>When all this and much more had been duly admired,
there were brought forward an empty casket
and fifteen trays, in which were an hundred thousand
ducats of gold, which were put into the casket "before
all the Signori." But our chronicler is compelled by his
love of truth to add reluctantly that there were several
false ducats among them.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>It is evident from the nature of many of the articles
in the above list, that this "trousseau" was not merely
a bride's fitting out purchased for the occasion, but
was a collection of all the Lady Bona's chattel property,
and represented, as was then usually the case
with all wealthy persons, a very large, if not the principal
part, of her worldly goods.</p>

<p>It may well be imagined, that Vittoria was not sorry
to return to the quiet and intellectual society of Ischia
after these tremendous three days at Naples. There
she was cheered from time to time by three or four
short visits from her husband; and by continual
tidings of his increasing reputation and advancement
in dignity and wealth; a prosperity which she considered
dearly purchased by his almost continual
absence. The death of her father Fabrizio in March,
1520, and that of her mother in 1522, made her feel
more poignantly this loneliness of heart.</p>

<p>In October of 1522, Pescara made a flying visit to
his wife and home. He was with her three days only,
and then hastened back to the army. It was the last
time she ever saw him. His career with the army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
meantime was very glorious. In May, 1522, he took
and sacked Genoa; "con la maggior crodelitate de lo
mundo," writes admiring Passeri. The plundering
lasted a day and a half; and "da che lo mundo fo
mundo," never was seen a sacking of so great riches,
"for there was not a single soldier who did not at the
least get a thousand ducats." Then, with the year
1525 came, on the 24th of February, the memorable
day of Pavia, which was so glorious that, as Passeri
writes, the desolation inflicted by it on the country
around was such, that neither house, tree, nor vine was
to be seen for miles. All was burned. Few living
creatures were to be met with, and those subsisting
miserably on roots.</p>

<p>The result of that "field of honour" is sufficiently
well known. Pescara, who received three wounds,
though none of them serious, in the battle, considered
that he was ill-used, when the royal captive Francis
was taken out of his hands to Spain, and made complaints
on the subject to his master Charles V., who
had succeeded Ferdinand on the thrones of Spain and
Naples in 1516. He was now, however, at the age of
thirty-five, general-in-chief for that monarch in Lombardy,
and enjoyed his perfect confidence, when circumstances
arose calculated to try his fidelity severely.
Whether that, almost the only virtue recognised,
honoured, and professed by his own class at that day,
remained altogether intact and unblemished is doubtful.
But it is certain, that in any view of the case, his
conduct was such as would consign him to utter infamy
in any somewhat more morally enlightened age
than his own, and such as any noble-hearted man,
however untaught, would have instinctively shrunk
from even then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">PESCARA'S TREACHERY.</div>

<p>The circumstances briefly were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Clement VII., who had succeeded to the Popedom
in 1523, had, after much trimming and vacillation between
Francis I. and Charles V., become, like the rest
of Italy, exceedingly alarmed at the preponderating
power of Charles, after the discomfiture of the French
at Pavia. Now the discontent of Pescara, mentioned
above, being notorious, the Pope and his counsellors,
especially Giberti, Bishop of Verona, and Morone,
Chancellor and Prime Minister of the Duke of Milan,
thought that it might not be impossible to induce him
to turn traitor to Charles, and make use of the army
under his command to crush once and for ever the
Spanish power in Italy. The prime mover and agent
in this conspiracy was Morone, who had the reputation
of being one of the profoundest and most far-sighted
statesmen of his day. Guicciardini<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> has recorded,
that he (the historian) had often heard Morone declare,
that there did not exist a worse or more faithless man
in all Italy than Pescara. The conspiring Chancellor,
therefore, being empowered by the Pope to promise
the malcontent general the throne of Naples as the
price of his treason, thought that he might well venture
to make the proposal.</p>

<p>Pescara received his overtures favourably, saying, that
<i>if he could be satisfied that what was proposed to him
could be done without injury to his honour</i>, he would
willingly undertake it, and accept the reward offered to
him.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Upon this reply being communicated to the
Pope, a couple of cardinals forthwith wrote to the
Marchese, assuring him that the treason required of
him was, "according to the dispositions and ordinances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
of the laws, civil as well as canon,"<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> perfectly consistent
with the nicest honour. Meanwhile, however,
it chanced, that one Messer Gismondo Santi, who had
been sent by the conspirators with letters on the subject
into France or Switzerland, was murdered for the
purpose of robbery by an innkeeper with whom he
lodged at Bergamo, and was buried under the staircase,
as was discovered some years afterwards. And
as no tidings were heard of this messenger, all engaged
in the plot, and Pescara among them, suspected that
he had been waylaid for the sake of his dispatches, and
that thus all was probably made known to Charles.
Thereupon Pescara immediately wrote to the Emperor,
revealing the whole conspiracy, and declaring that he
had given ear to their proposals only for the purpose of
obtaining full information of the conspirators' designs.</p>

<p>Such is the version of the story given by Varchi,
probably the most trustworthy of all the numerous
contemporary historians. He adds, "it is not unknown
to me, that many say, and perhaps think, that the
Marchese, acting loyally from the beginning, had all
along given the emperor true information of everything;
all which I, for my part, knowing nothing
further than what I have said, will not undertake to
deny. It would, indeed, be agreeable to me to believe
that it was so, rather than that the character of so
great a soldier should be stained with so foul a blot.
Though, indeed, I know not what sort of loyalty or
sincerity that may be, which consists in having deceived
and betrayed by vile trickery and fraud a Pope,
who, if nothing else, was at least very friendly to him,
a republic such as that of Venice, and many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
personages, for the sake of acquiring favour with his
master. This I know well, that the lady Vittoria
Colonna, his wife, a woman of the highest character,
and abounding in all the virtues which can adorn her
sex, had no sooner heard of the intrigue on foot, than,
wholly untempted by the brilliant hope hung out to
her, she with infinite sorrow and anxiety wrote most
warmly to her husband, urging him to bethink him of
his hitherto unstained character, and to weigh well
what he was about, assuring him that as far as she was
concerned, she had no wish to be the wife of a king,
but only of a loyal and upright man."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER LETTER TO HER HUSBAND.</div>

<p>This letter from Vittoria, urging her husband not
to be seduced to swerve from the path of honour and
duty, is recorded by most of the writers; and Visconti
asserts, that it was the means of inducing Pescara to
abandon the idea of betraying his sovereign. At all
events, the existence of such a letter is very strong
evidence that Pescara had <i>not</i> from the first informed
Charles of the plot, but <i>had</i> at least hesitated whether
he should not join in it, inasmuch as his communications
to her upon the subject had given her reason to
fear lest he should do so.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is fair to observe, that several
of those concerned in the intrigue saw reason to suspect
the possibility of Pescara's having from the first
listened to their overtures only to betray them; as is
proved by extant letters from one to another of them.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps this, too, was consistent with the nicest
honour, as defined "by the ordinances of canon and
civil law." But whether he were a traitor to his king
or not, he was determined to shrink from no depth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
treachery towards his dupes, that could serve to ingratiate
him with his master. While still feigning to
accede to their proposals, he sent to Morone to come
to him at Novara, that all might be arranged between
them. Morone, against the advice of many of his
friends, and, as Guicciardini thought,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> with a degree of
imprudence astonishing in so practised and experienced
a man, went to the meeting. He was received in the
most cordial manner by Pescara, who, as soon as they
were alone together, led him to speak of all the details
of the proposed plan. The trap was complete; for
behind the hangings of the room in which they were
sitting, he had hidden Antonio da Leyva, one of the
generals of the Spanish army, who arrested him as he
was quitting the house, and took him to the prison of
Novara, where Pescara the next day had the brazen
audacity to examine as a judge the man whom a few
hours previously he had talked with as an accomplice.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Surely, whichever version of the story may be
believed, as to Pescara's original intentions, there is
enough here in evidence to go far towards justifying
Chancellor Morone's opinion, that he was one of the
worst and most faithless men in Italy. Some modern
Italian writers, with little moral, and less historical
knowledge, have rested the gravamen of the charge
against him on his want of patriotic Italian feeling on
the occasion. In the first place, no such motive, however
laudable in itself, could have justified him in being
guilty of the treason proposed to him. In the second
place, the class of ideas in question can hardly be
found to have had any existence at that period, although
distinct traces of such may be met with in Italian history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
200 years earlier. Certainly the Venetian Senate
were not actuated by any such; and still more absurd
would it be to attribute them to Pope Clement. It is
possible that Morone, and perhaps still more, Giberti,
may not have been untinctured by them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PESCARA'S SPANISH TENDENCIES.</div>

<p>But Pescara was one of the last men, even had he
been as high-minded as we find him to have been the
reverse, in whom to look for Italian "<i>fuori i barbari</i>"
enthusiasm. Of noble Spanish blood, his family had
always been the counsellors, friends, and close adherents
of a Spanish dynasty at Naples, and the man
himself was especially Spanish in all his sympathies
and ideas. "He adopted,"<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> says Giovio, "in all his
costume the Spanish fashion, and always preferred to
speak in that language to such a degree, that with
Italians, and even with Vittoria his wife, he talked
Spanish." And elsewhere he is said to have been in
the habit of expressing his regret that he was not born
a Spaniard.</p>

<p class="b1">Such habits and sentiments would have been painful
enough to a wife, a Roman and a Colonna, if Vittoria
had been sufficiently in advance of her age to have
conceived patriotic ideas of Italian nationality. But
though her pursuits and studies were infinitely more
likely to have led her mind to such thoughts, than were
those of the actors in the political drama of the time
to generate any such notions in them, yet no trace of
any sentiment of the kind is to be found in her writings.
Considering the extent of the field over which her
mind had travelled, her acquaintance with classical
literature, and with the history of her own country, it
may seem surprising that a nature, certainly capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
high and noble aspirations, should have remained untouched
by one of the noblest. That it was so is a
striking proof of the utter insensibility of the age to
any feelings of the sort. It is possible too, that the
tendencies and modes of thought of her husband on
the subject of Italy may have exercised a repressing
influence in this respect on Vittoria's mind; for who
does not know how powerfully a woman's intelligence
and heart may be elevated or degraded by the nature
of the object of her affections; and, doubtless, to
Vittoria as to so many another of every age do the
admirable lines of the poet address themselves:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp30">"Thou shalt lower to his level day by day,</p>
<p class="ppl20">What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathise with clay.</p>
<p class="ppl20">As the husband is, the wife is; thou art mated with a clown,</p>
<p class="ppl20">And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down."</p>

<p class="p1">When we come to examine the tone of sentiment
prevailing in Vittoria's poetry, other indications of this
deteriorating influence will be perceptible, and if much
of nobleness, purity, high aspiration be nevertheless
still found in her, this partial immunity from the evil
influence must be attributed to the trifling duration of
that portion of her life passed in her husband's company.</p>

<p>Pescara was not unrewarded for the infamy with
which he covered himself in the service of his master.
He obtained the rank of Generalissimo of the imperial
forces in Italy. But he enjoyed the gratification for a
very little while. In the latter end of that year, he
fell into a state of health which seems to have been not
well accounted for by the medical science of that day.
The wounds he had received at Pavia in the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
February are specially described by Passeri as having
been very slight. Some writers have supposed that
either shame for the part he had acted in the Morone
affair, or, with greater probability, misgiving as to the
possibility of the emperor's discovering the real truth
of the facts (for the fate of Gismondo Santi and his
papers was not known yet), was the real cause of his
illness. It seems clearly to have been of the nature
of a sudden and premature decay of all the vital
forces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PESCARA'S DEATH.</div>

<p>Towards the end of the year he abandoned all hope
of recovery, and sent to his wife to desire her to come
to him with all speed. He was then at Milan. She
set out instantly on her painful journey, and had
reached Viterbo on her way northwards, when she was
met by the news of his death.</p>

<p>It took place on the 25th of November, 1525. He
was buried on the 30th of that month, says Giovio, at
Milan; but the body was shortly afterwards transported
with great pomp and magnificence to Naples.</p>

<p class="pbqi">Vittoria, a Widow, with the Nuns of San Silvestro.&mdash;Returns to Ischia.&mdash;Her
Poetry divisible into two classes.&mdash;Specimens of her Sonnets.&mdash;They
rapidly attain celebrity throughout Italy.&mdash;Vittoria's
sentiments towards her Husband.&mdash;Her unblemished Character.&mdash;Platonic
Love.&mdash;The Love Poetry of the Sixteenth Century.</p>


<p class="pn p2">Vittoria became thus a widow in the thirty-sixth
year of her age. She was still in the full pride of her
beauty, as contemporary writers assert, and as two
extant medals, struck at Milan shortly before her
husband's death, attest. One of them presents the
bust of Pescara on the obverse, and that of Vittoria on
the reverse; the other has the same portrait of her on
the obverse, and a military trophy on the reverse.
The face represented is a very beautiful one, and
seen thus in profile is perhaps more pleasing than
the portrait, which has been spoken of in a previous
chapter. She was moreover even now probably the
most celebrated woman in Italy, although she had done
little as yet to achieve that immense reputation which
awaited her a few years later. Very few probably of
her sonnets were written before the death of her
husband.</p>

<p>But the exalted rank and prominent position of her
own family, the high military grade and reputation of
her husband, the wide-spread hopes and fears of which
he had recently been the centre in the affair of the
conspiracy, joined to the fame of her talents, learning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
and virtues, which had been made the subject of enthusiastic
praise by nearly all the Ischia knot of poets and
wits, rendered her a very conspicuous person in the eyes
of all Italy. Her husband's premature and unexpected
death added a source of interest of yet another kind to
her person. A young, beautiful, and very wealthy
widow, gave rise to quite as many hopes, speculations,
and designs in the sixteenth century as in any other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SADOLETO'S BULL.</div>

<p>But Vittoria's first feeling, on receiving that fatal
message at Viterbo, was, that she could never again
face that world, which was so ready to open its arms to
her. Escape from the world, solitude, a cell, whose
walls should resemble, as nearly as might be, those of
the grave, since that asylum was denied to her, was
her only wish. And she hastened, stunned by her
great grief, to Rome, with the intention of throwing
herself into a cloister. The convent of San Silvestro
in Capite&mdash;so called from the supposed possession by
the community of the Baptist's head&mdash;had always been
a special object of veneration to the Colonna family;
and there she sought a retreat. Her many friends,
well knowing the desperation of her affliction, feared,
that acting under the spur of its first violence, she
would take the irrevocable step of pronouncing the
vows. That a Vittoria Colonna should be so lost to
the world was not to be thought of. So, Jacopo Sadoleto,
Bishop of Carpentras, and afterwards made a
cardinal by Pope Paul III., one of the most learned
men of his day, himself a poet, and an intimate friend
of Vittoria, hastened to Pope Clement, whose secretary
he was at the time, and obtained from him a brief
addressed to the abbess and nuns of San Silvestro,
enjoining them to receive into their house, and console
to the best of their ability the Marchesana di Pescara,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
"omnibus spiritualibus et temporalibus consolationibus,"
but forbidding them, under pain of the
greater excommunication, to permit her to take the
veil, "impetu potius sui doloris, quam maturo consilio
circa mutationem vestium vidualium in monasticas."</p>

<p>This brief is dated the 7th December, 1525.</p>

<p>She remained with the sisters of San Silvestro till
the autumn of the following year; and would have
further deferred returning into a world which the conditions
of the times made less than ever tempting to
her, had not her brother Ascanio, now her only
remaining natural protector, taken her from the convent
to Marino, in consequence of the Colonna clan
being once again at war with the Pope, as partisans of
the Emperor.</p>

<p>On the 20th of September, 1526, this ever turbulent
family raised a tumult in Rome to the cry of "Imperio!
Imperio! Libertà! Libertà! Colonna! Colonna!"
and sacked the Vatican, and every house belonging to
the Orsini;<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> the old clan hatred showing itself as
usual on every pretext and opportunity.</p>

<p>The result was a papal decree, depriving Cardinal
Colonna of his hat; and declaring confiscated all the
estates of the family. Deeply grieved by all these
excesses, both by the lawless violence of her kinsmen,
and by the punishment incurred by them, she left
Marino, and once more returned to the retirement of
Ischia in the beginning of 1527. It was well for her
that she had decided on not remaining in or near Rome
during that fatal year. While the eternal city and its
neighbourhood were exposed to the untold horrors and
atrocities committed by the soldiers of the Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Catholic King, Vittoria was safe in her island home,
torn indeed to the heart by the tidings which reached
her of the ruin and dispersion of many valued friends,
but at least tranquil and secure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN MEMORIAM.</div>

<p class="b1">And now, if not perhaps while she was still with the
nuns of San Silvestro, began her life as a poetess.
She had hitherto written but little, and occasionally
only. Henceforward, poetical composition seems to
have made the great occupation of her life. Visconti,
the latest, and by far the best editor of her works, has
divided them into two portions. With two or three
unimportant exceptions, of which the letter to her
husband already noticed is the most considerable, they
consist entirely of sonnets. The first of Signor Visconti's
divisions, comprising 134 sonnets, includes
those inspired almost entirely by her grief for the loss
of her husband. They form a nearly uninterrupted
series "In Memoriam," in which the changes are
rung with infinite ingenuity on a very limited number
of ideas, all turning on the glory and high qualities of
him whom she had lost, and her own undiminished
and hopeless misery.</p>

<p class="ppq20">
"I only write to vent that inward pain,<br />
On which my heart doth feed itself, nor wills<br />
Aught other nourishment,"</p>

<p class="p1 pn">begins the first of these elegiac sonnets; in which she
goes on to disclaim any idea of increasing her husband's
glory,&mdash;"non per giunger lume al mio bel sole;"
which is the phrase she uses invariably to designate
him. This fancy of alluding to Pescara always by the
same not very happily chosen metaphor, contributes
an additional element of monotony to verses still
further deprived of variety by the identity of their
highly artificial form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>This form, it is hardly necessary to remark, more
than any other mode of the lyre, needs and exhibits
the beauties of accurate finish and neat polish. Shut
out, as it is, by its exceeding artificiality and difficult
construction from many of the higher beauties of more
spontaneous poetical utterance, the sonnet, "totus,
teres atque rotundus," is nothing if not elaborated to
gem-like perfection.</p>

<p class="b1">Yet Vittoria writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"Se in man prender non soglio unqua la lima<br />
Del buon giudicio, e ricercando intorno<br />
Con occhio disdegnoso, io non adorno<br />
Nè tergo la mia rozza incolta rima,</p>
<p class="psi20">Nasce perchè non è mia cura prima<br />
Procacciar di ciò lode, o fuggir scorno;<br />
Nè che dopo il mio lieto al ciel ritorno<br />
Viva ella al mondo in più onorata stima.</p>
<p class="psi20">Ma dal foco divin, che 'l mio intelletto<br />
Sua mercè infiamma, convien che escan fuore<br />
Mal mio grado talor queste faville.</p>
<p class="psi20">E se alcuna di loro un gentil core<br />
Avvien che scaldi, mille volte e mille<br />
Ringraziar debbo il mio felice errore."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Which may be thus Englished with tolerable accuracy
of meaning, if not with much poetical elegance.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p class="psq20">"If in these rude and artless songs of mine<br />
I never take the file in hand, nor try<br />
With curious care, and nice fastidious eye,<br />
To deck and polish each uncultured line,</p>
<p class="psi20">'Tis that it makes small portion of my aim<br />
To merit praise, or 'scape scorn's blighting breath;<br />
Or that my verse, when I have welcomed death,<br />
May live rewarded with the meed of fame.</p>
<p class="psi20">But it must be that Heaven's own gracious gift,<br />
Which with its breath divine inspires my soul,<br />

<p class="psi20">And should one such but haply serve to lift<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">SPECIMENS OF SONNETS.</div>

<p class="p1 b1">Again, in another sonnet, of which the first eight
lines are perhaps as favourable a specimen of a really
poetical image as can be found throughout her writings,
she repeats the same profession of "pouring an unpremeditated
lay."</p>

<p class="psq20">"Qual digiuno augellin, che vede ed ode<br />

Per desio di seguirla anch'ei volando,<br />
E la ringrazia in tal modo cantando,<br />
Che par ch'oltre 'l poter la lingua snode;</p>

Più del usato lucido lampeggia,</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Which in English runs pretty exactly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"Like to a hungry nestling bird, that hears<br />

Wishful to follow her free wanderings,<br />

That the free voice beyond his strength appears;</p>
<p class="psi20">So I, whene'er the warm and living glow<br />

<p class="psi20">Urged by the force of my deep love; and so<br />

<p class="p1">The reader conversant with Italian poetry will have
already seen enough to make him aware, that the
Colonna's compositions are by no means, unkempt,
unpolished, or spontaneous. The merit of them consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
in the high degree, to which they are exactly the
reverse of all this. They are ingenious, neat, highly
studied, elegant, and elaborate. It may be true,
indeed, that much thought was not expended on the
subject matter; but it was not spared on the diction,
versification, and form. So much so, that many of her
sonnets were retouched, altered, improved, and finally
left to posterity, in a form very different from that in
which they were first handed round the literary world
of Italy.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The file in truth was constantly in hand;
though the nice fastidious care bestowed in dressing
out with curious conceits a jejune or trite thought,
which won the enthusiastic applause of her contemporaries,
does not to the modern reader compensate for
the absence of passion, earnestness, and reality.</p>

<p>Then, again, the declaration of the songstress of these
would-be "wood notes wild," that they make no pretension
to the meed of praise, nor care to escape contempt,
nor are inspired by any hope of a life of fame
after the author's death, leads us to contrast with such
professions the destiny that really did,&mdash;surely not
altogether unsought,&mdash;await these grief-inspired utterances
of a breaking heart during the author's lifetime.</p>

<p>No sooner was each memory-born pang illustrated
by an ingenious metaphor, or pretty simile packed
neatly in its regulation case of fourteen lines with their
complexity of twofold rhymes all right, than it was
handed all over Italy. Copies were as eagerly sought
for as <i>the</i> novel of the season at a nineteenth-century
circulating library. Cardinals, bishops, poets, wits,
diplomatists, passed them from one to another, made
them the subject of their correspondence with each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
other, and with the fair mourner; and eagerly looked
out for the next poetical bonne bouche which her
undying grief and constancy to her "bel sole" should
send them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOOD-NOTES WILD.</div>

<p>The enthusiasm created by these tuneful wailings
of a young widow as lovely as inconsolable, as irreproachable
as noble, learned enough to correspond
with the most learned men of the day on their own
subjects, and with all this a Colonna, was intense.
Vittoria became speedily the most famous woman of
her day, was termed by universal consent "the divine,"
and lived to see three editions of the grief-cries, which
escaped from her "without her will."</p>

<p class="b1">Here is a sonnet, which was probably written at the
time of her return to Ischia in 1527; when the sight
of all the well-loved scenery of the home of her happy
years must have brought to her mind Dante's&mdash;</p>

<p class="pph20">
"Nessun maggior dolore<br />
Che ricordarsi del tempo felice<br />
Nella miseria!"</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Vittoria looks back on the happy time as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">
"Oh! che tranquillo mar, oh che chiare onde<br />
Solcava già la mia spalmata barca,<br />
Di ricca e nobil merce adorna e carca,<br />
Con l'aer puro, e con l'aure seconde,</p>
<p class="psi20">Il ciel, ch'ora i bei vaghi lumi asconde<br />
Porgea serena luce e d'ombra scarca;<br />
Ahi! quanto ha da temer chi lieto varca!<br />
Chè non sempre al principio il fin risponde.</p>
<p class="psi20">Ecco l'empia e volubile fortuna<br />
Scoperse poi l'irata iniqua fronte,<br />
Dal cui furor sì gran procella insorge.</p>
<p class="psi20">Venti, pioggia, saette insieme aduna,<br />
E fiere intorno a divorarmi pronte;<br />
Ma l'alma ancor la fida Stella scorge."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 b1">In English, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"On what smooth seas, on what clear waves did sail<br />
My fresh careenèd bark! what costly freight<br />
Of noble merchandise adorn'd its state!<br />
How pure the breeze, how favouring the gale!</p>
<p class="psi20">And Heaven, which now its beauteous rays doth veil,<br />
Shone then serene and shadowless. But fate<br />
For the too happy voyager lies in wait.<br />
Oft fair beginnings in their endings fail.</p>
<p class="psi20">And now doth impious changeful fortune bare<br />
Her angry ruthless brow, whose threat'ning power<br />
Rouses the tempest, and lets loose its war!</p>
<p class="psi20">But though rains, winds, and lightnings fill the air,<br />
And wild beasts seek to rend me and devour,<br />
Still shines o'er my true soul its faithful star."</p>

<p class="p1">Bearing in mind what we have seen of Pescara, it
would seem evident, that some monstrous illusion with
respect to him must have obscured Vittoria's mind and
judgment. It might have been expected that she
would have been found attributing to him high and
noble qualities, which existed only in her own imagination.
But it is remarkable that, though in general
terms she speaks of him as all that was noblest and
greatest, yet in describing his merits, she confines
herself to the few which he really had. This highly
cultured, devout, thoughtful, intellectual woman,
seems really to have believed, that a mercenary
swordsman's calling was the noblest occupation earth
could offer, and the successful following of it the best
preparation and surest title to immortal happiness
hereafter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SONNET TO HER HUSBAND.</div>

<p class="b1">The following sonnet is one of many expressing the
same sentiments.</p>

<p class="psq20">"Alle Vittorie tue, mio lume eterno,<br />

Per cortesia od ardir rimaser vinte.</p>
<p class="psi20">Salisti al mondo i più pregiati gradi;<br />
Or godi in ciel d'altri trionfi e veri,<br />

<p class="p1 b1">Which may be Englished as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"To thy great victories, my eternal light,<br />
Nor time, nor seasons, lent their favouring aid;<br />

<p class="p1 b1">Often her wishes for death are checked by the
consideration, that haply her virtue may not suffice
to enable her to rejoin her husband in the mansions of
the blest. Take the following example:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"Quando del suo tormento il cor si duole<br />
Si ch'io bramo il mio fin, timor m'assale,<br />
E dice; il morir tosto a che ti vale<br />

<p class="psq20">"When of its pangs my heart doth sore complain,<br />
So that I long to die, fear falls on me,<br />
And saith, what boots such early death to thee,<br />
If far from thy bright sun thou should'st remain.</p>
<p class="psi20">Then oft from this cold fear is born again<br />
A fervent boldness, which doth presently<br />
Lend my soul wings, so that mortality<br />
Strives to put off its worldly wishes vain.</p>
<p class="psi20">For this, my spirit here herself enfolds,<br />
And hides from human joys; and not for fame,<br />
Nor empty praise, nor overblown conceit;</p>
<p class="psi20">But that she hears her sun still call her name,<br />
And still, where'er she looks, his face doth meet,<br />

<p class="p1 b1">A similar cast of thought, both as regards her own
disgust of life and the halo of sanctity, which by some
mysterious process of mind she was able to throw
around her husband's memory, is found again in this,
the last of the sonnets, selected to illustrate this phase
of our poetess's mind, and exemplify the first division
of her writings.</p>

<p class="p1">In considering the collection of 117 sonnets, from
which the above specimens have been selected, and
which were probably the product of about seven or eight
years, from 1526 to 1533–4 (in one she laments that
the seventh year from her husband's death should
have brought with it no alleviation of her grief); the
most interesting question that suggests itself, is,&mdash;whether
we are to suppose the sentiments expressed
in them to be genuine outpourings of the heart, or
rather to consider them all as part of the professional
equipment of a poet, earnest only in the work of
achieving a high and brilliant poetical reputation?
The question is a prominent one, as regards the concrete
notion to be formed of the sixteenth-century
woman, Vittoria Colonna; and is not without interest
as bearing on the great subject of woman's nature.</p>

<p>Vittoria's moral conduct, both as a wife and as a
widow, was wholly irreproachable. A mass of concurrent
contemporary testimony seems to leave no doubt
whatever on this point. More than one of the poets of
her day professed themselves her ardent admirers,
devoted slaves, and despairing lovers, according to the
most approved poetical and Platonic fashion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
time; and she received their inflated bombast not
unpleased with the incense, and answered them with
other bombast, all <i>en règle</i> and in character. The
"carte de tendre" was then laid down on the Platonic
projection; and the sixteenth century fashion in this
respect was made a convenient screen, for those to
whom a screen was needful, quite as frequently as the
less classical whimsies of a later period. But Platonic
love to Vittoria was merely an occasion for indulging in
the spiritualistic pedantries, by which the classicists of
that day sought to link the infant metaphysical speculations
then beginning to grow out of questions of
church doctrine, with the ever-interesting subject of
romantic love.</p>

<p>A recent French writer,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> having translated into
prose Vittoria's poetical epistle to her husband, adds
that she has been "obliged to veil and soften certain
passages which might damage the writer's poetical
character in the eyes of her fair readers, by exhibiting
her as more woman than poet in the ardent and
'positive' manner, in which she speaks of her love."
Never was there a more calumnious insinuation. It is
true indeed that the Frenchwoman omits, or slurs
over some passages of the original, but as they are
wholly void of the shadow of offence, it can only be
supposed that the translator did not understand the
meaning of them.</p>

<p>There is no word in Vittoria's poetry which can lead
to any other conclusion on this point, than that she
was, in her position and social rank, an example, rare
at that period, not only of perfect regularity of conduct,
but of great purity and considerable elevation of mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Such other indications as we have of her moral nature
are all favourable. We find her, uninfluenced by the
bitter hereditary hatreds of her family, striving to act
as peacemaker between hostile factions, and weeping
over the mischiefs occasioned by their struggles. We
find her the constant correspondent and valued friend of
almost every good and great man of her day. And if
her scheme of moral doctrine, as gatherable from that
portion of her poems which we have not yet examined,
be narrow,&mdash;as how should it be otherwise,&mdash;yet it is
expressive of a mind habitually under the influence of
virtuous aspiration, and is more humanising in its
tendencies, than that generally prevalent around her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PESCARA'S CHARACTER.</div>

<p>Such was Vittoria Colonna. It has been seen what
her husband Pescara was. And the question arises,&mdash;how
far can it be imagined possible that she should
not only have lavished on him to the last while living,
all the treasures of an almost idolatrous affection; not
only have looked back on his memory after his death
with fondness and charitable, even blindly charitable,
indulgence; but should absolutely have so canonised
him in her imagination as to have doubted of her own
fitness to consort hereafter with a soul so holy!
It may be said, that Vittoria did not know her
husband as we know him; that the few years they
had passed together had no doubt shown her only
the better phases of his character. But she knew
that he had at least doubted whether he should not be
false to his sovereign, and had been most infamously
so to his accomplices or dupes. She knew at least
all that Giovio's narrative could tell her; for the
bishop presented it to her, and received a sonnet in
return.</p>

<p>But it is one of the most beautiful properties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
woman's nature, some men say, that their love has
power to blind their judgment. Novelists and poets
are fond of representing women whose affections remain
unalterably fixed on their object, despite the
manifest unworthiness of it; and set such examples before
us, as something high, noble, admirable, "beautiful;"
to the considerable demoralisation of their
confiding students of either sex. There <i>is</i> a tendency
in woman to refuse at all risks the dethroning of the
sovereign she has placed on her heart's throne. The
pain of deposing him is so great, that she is tempted
to abase her own soul to escape it; for it is only at
that cost that it can be escaped. And the spectacle of
a fine nature "dragged down to sympathise with clay,"
is not "beautiful," but exceedingly the reverse. Men
do not usually set forth as worthy of admiration&mdash;though
a certain school of writers do even this, in the
trash talked of love at first sight&mdash;that kind of love
between the sexes, which arises from causes wholly
independent of the higher part of our nature. Yet it
is that love alone which can survive esteem. And it is
highly important to the destinies of woman, that she
should understand and be thoroughly persuaded, that
she cannot love that which does not merit love, without
degrading her own nature; that under whatsoever
circumstances love should cease when respect, approbation,
and esteem have come to an end; and that
those who find poetry and beauty in the love which no
moral change in its object can kill, are simply teaching
her to attribute a fatally debasing supremacy to those
lower instincts of our nature, on whose due subordination
to the diviner portion of our being all nobleness,
all moral purity and spiritual progress depends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POETICAL PLATONISM.</div>

<p>Vittoria Colonna was not one whose intellectual and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
moral self had thus abdicated its sceptre. The texture
of her mind and its habits of thought forbid the supposition;
and, bearing this in mind, it becomes wholly
impossible to accept the glorification of her "bel sole,"
which makes the staple of the first half of her poems,
as the sincere expression of genuine feeling and
opinion.</p>

<p>She was probably about as much in earnest as was
her great model and master, Petrarch, in his adoration
of Laura. The poetical mode of the day was almost
exclusively Petrarchist; and the abounding Castalian
fount of that half century in "the land of song"
played from its thousand jets little else than Petrarch
and water in different degrees of dilution. Vittoria
has no claim to be excepted from the "servum pecus,"
though her imitation has more of self-derived vigour to
support it. And this assumption of a mighty, undying,
exalted and hopeless passion, was a necessary part of
the poet's professional appurtenances. Where could a
young and beautiful widow, of unblemished conduct,
who had no intention of changing her condition, and
no desire to risk misconstruction by the world, find
this needful part of her outfit as a poet, so unobjectionably
as in the memory of her husband, sanctified
and exalted by the imagination to the point proper for
the purpose.</p>

<p>For want of a deeper spiritual insight, and a larger
comprehension of the finer affections of the human
heart and the manifestations of them, with the Italian
poets of the "rénaissance," love-poetry was little else
than the expression of passion in the most restricted
sense of the term. But they were often desirous of
elevating, purifying, and spiritualising their theme. And
how was this to be accomplished? The gratification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
of passion, such as they painted, would, they felt, have
led them quite in a different direction from that they
were seeking. A hopeless passion therefore, one
whose wishes the reader was perfectly to understand
were never destined to be gratified&mdash;better still, one by
the nature of things impossible to be gratified&mdash;this
was the contrivance by which love was to be poetised
and moralised.</p>

<p>The passion-poetry, which addressed itself to the
memory of one no more, met the requirements of the case
exactly; and Vittoria's ten years despair and lamentations,
her apotheosis of the late cavalry captain, and
longing to rejoin him, must be regarded as poetical properties
brought out for use, when she sat down to make
poetry for the perfectly self-conscious, though very laudable
purpose of acquiring for herself a poet's reputation.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that anything in the
nature of hypocrisy was involved in the assumption of
the poetical rôle of inconsolable widow. Everybody
understood that the poetess was only making poetry, and
saying the usual and proper things for that purpose.
She was no more attempting to impose on anybody
than was a poet when on entering some "academia"
he termed himself Tyrtæus or Lycidas, instead of
the name inherited from his father.</p>

<p>And from this prevailing absence of all real and
genuine feeling, arises the utter coldness and shallow
insipidity of the poets of that time and school. Literature
has probably few more unreadable departments
than the productions of the Petrarchists of the beginning
of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Vittoria, when she began to write on religious subjects,
was more in earnest; and the result, as we shall
see, is accordingly improved.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The noble rivalry of Francis I. and Charles V. was
again, in 1530, making Naples a field of glory in such
sort, that outraged nature appeared also on the scene
with pestilence in her hand. The first infliction had
driven most of the literary society in Naples to take
refuge in the comparative security of Ischia. The
latter calamity had reached even that retreat; and
Vittoria some time in that year again visited Rome.</p>

<p>Life was beginning there to return to its usual conditions
after the tremendous catastrophe of 1527.
Pestilence had there also, as usual, followed in the
train of war and military license. And many in all
classes had been its victims. Great numbers fled from
the city, and among these were probably most of such
as were honoured by Vittoria's personal friendship.
Now they were venturing back to their old haunts on
the Pincian, the Quirinal, or those favourite Colonna
gardens, still ornamented by the ruins of Aurelian's
Temple to the Sun. The tide of modern Goths, who
had threatened to make the eternal city's name a
mockery, had been swept back at the word of that
second and "most Catholic" Alaric, Charles V. Cardinals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
poetasters, wits, Ciceronian bishops, statesmen,
ambassadors, and artists, busy in the achievement of
immortality, were once more forming a society, which
gave the Rome of that day a fair title to be considered,
in some points of view, the capital of the world. The
golden Roman sunlight was still glowing over aqueduct,
arch and temple; and Rome the Eternal was
herself again.</p>

<p>By this varied and distinguished society Vittoria
was received with open arms. The Colonna family had
become reconciled to Pope Clement, and had had their
fiefs restored to them; so that there was no cloud on
the political horizon to prevent the celebrated Marchesana
from receiving the homage of all parties. The
Marchese del Vasto, Vittoria's former pupil, for whom
she never ceased to feel the warmest affection, was also
then at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> In his company, and that of some
others of the gifted knot around her, Vittoria visited
the ruins and vestiges of ancient Rome with all the
enthusiasm of one deeply versed in classic lore, and
thoroughly imbued with the then prevailing admiration
for the works and memorials of Pagan antiquity.
Vittoria's sister-in-law, Donna Giovanna d'Aragona,
the beautiful and accomplished wife of her brother
Ascanio, in whose house she seems to have been living
during this visit to Rome, was doubtless one of the
party on these occasions. The poet Molza has chronicled
his presence among them in more than one
sonnet. His muse would seem to have "made increment
of anything." For no less than four sonnets<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
were the result of the exclamation from Vittoria, "Ah
happy they"&mdash;the ancients, "who lived in days so full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
of beauty!" Of course, various pretty things were
obtainable out of this. Among others, we have the

<div class="sidenote">VISIT TO ROME.</div>

<p>It would have been preferable to have had preserved
for us some further scraps from the lips of Vittoria,
while the little party gazed at sunset over that matchless
view of the aqueduct-bestridden Campagna from
the terrace at the western front of the Lateran, looked
up at the Colosseum, ghostly in the moonlight, from
the arch of Titus, or discoursed on the marvellous
proportions of the Pantheon.</p>

<p>But history rarely guesses aright what the after-ages
she works for would most thank her for handing
down to them. And we must be content to construct
for ourselves, as best we may, from the stray hints we
have, the singularly pleasing picture of these sixteenth
century rambles among the ruins of Rome by as
remarkable a company of pilgrims as any of the
thousands who have since trodden in their steps.</p>

<p>Vittoria's visit to Rome upon this occasion was a
short one. It was probably early in the following year
that she returned to Ischia. Signor Visconti attributes
this journey to the restlessness arising from a
heart ill at ease, vainly hoping to find relief from its
misery by change of place. He assumes all the expressions
of despair to be found in her sonnets of this
period, to be so many reliable autobiographical documents,
and builds his narrative upon them accordingly.
To this period he attributes the sonnet, translated in
a previous chapter, in which the poetess declares that
she has no wish to conceal from the world the temptation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
to suicide which assails her. And in commemoration
of this mood of mind, he adds, in further
proof of the sad truth, a medal was struck upon this
occasion, in Rome, of which he gives an engraving. It
represents, on one side, the inconsolable lady as a
handsome, well nourished, comfortable-looking widow,
in mourning weeds, more aged in appearance, certainly,
since the striking of the former medal spoken of, than
the lapse of seven years would seem sufficient to
account for. And, on the reverse, is a representation
of the melancholy story of Pyramus and Thisbe, the
former lying dead at the feet of the typical paragon,
who is pointing towards her breast a sword, grasped
in both hands, half-way down the blade, in a manner
sure to have cut her fingers. The two sides of the
medal, seen at one glance, as in Signor Visconti's
engraving, are, it must be admitted, calculated to give
rise to ideas the reverse of pathetic.</p>

<p>To this period too belongs the sonnet, also previously
alluded to, in which Vittoria speaks of the
seventh year of her bereavement having arrived,
without bringing with it any mitigation of her woe.
Signor Visconti takes this for simple autobiographical
material. It is curious, as a specimen of the modes of
thought at the time, to see how the same passage is
handled by Vittoria's first editor and commentator,
Rinaldo Corsi, who published her works for the second
time at Venice in 1558. His commentary begins as
follows:&mdash;"On this sonnet, it remains for me to speak
of the number Seven as I have done already of the
number Four. But since Varro, Macrobius, and
Aulus Gellius, together with many others, have treated
largely of the subject, I will only add this,&mdash;which,
perhaps, Ladies, may appear to you somewhat strange;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
that, according to Hippocrates, the number four enters
twice into the number seven; and I find it stated by
most credible authors as a certain fact, and proved by
the testimony of their own observation, that a male
child of seven years old has been known to cure persons
afflicted by the infirmity called scrofula by no
other means than by the hidden virtue of that number
seven," &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MESSER RINALDO CORSO.</div>

<p>In this sort, Messer Rinaldo Corso composed, and
the literary ladies, to whom throughout, as in the
above passage, his labours are especially dedicated,
must be supposed to have read more than five hundred
close-printed pages of commentary on the works of the
celebrated poetess, who, in all probability, when she
penned the sonnet in question, had no more intention
of setting forth the reasons for her return to Ischia,
than she had of alluding to the occult properties of
the mysterious number seven. The natural supposition
is, that as she had been driven from her home by
the pestilence, she returned to it when that reason for
absence was at an end.</p>

<p>There she seems to have remained tranquilly employed
on her favourite pursuits, increasing her already
great reputation, and corresponding assiduously with
all the best and most distinguished men of Italy,
whether laymen or ecclesiastics, till the year 1536.</p>

<p>In that year she again visited Rome, and resided
during her stay there with Donna Giovanna d'Aragona,
her sister-in-law. Paul III., Farnese, had in 1534
succeeded Clement in the chair of St. Peter; and
though Paul was on many accounts very far from
being a good Pope or a good priest, yet the Farnese
was an improvement on the Medici. As ever,
Rome began to show signs of improvement when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
danger to her system from without began to make
itself felt. Paul seems very soon to have become convinced
that the general council, which had been so
haunting a dread to Clement during the whole of his
pontificate, could no longer be avoided. But it was
still hoped in the council chambers of the Vatican that
the doctrinal difficulties of the German reformers,
which threatened the Church with so fatal a schism,
might be got over by conciliation and dexterous theological
diplomacy. As soon as it became evident that
this hope was vain, fear began to influence the papal
policy, and at its bidding the ferocious persecuting
bigotry of Paul IV. was contrasted with the shameless
profligacy of Alexander, the epicurean indifferentism
of Leo, and the pettifogging worldliness of Clement.</p>

<p>Between these two periods came Paul III., and the
illusory hopes that the crisis might be tided over by
finding some arrangement of terminology, which should
satisfy the reformers, while Rome should abandon no
particle of doctrine on which any vital portion of her
system of temporal power was based. To meet the
exigencies of this period, Paul III. signalised his
accession by raising to the purple a number of the
most earnest, most learned, and truly devout men in
Italy. Contarini, the Venetian; Caraffa, from Naples;
Sadoleto, Bishop of Carpentras; Pole, then a fugitive
from England; Giberti, Bishop of Verona; and Fregoso,
Archbishop of Salerno, were men chosen solely
on account of their eminent merit.</p>

<p>With most, if not all of these, Vittoria was connected
by the bonds of intimate friendship. With
Contarini, Sadoleto, and Pole, especially, she corresponded;
and the esteem felt for her by such men is
the most undeniable testimony to the genuine worth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
her character. It is easy to imagine, therefore, how
warm a reception awaited her arrival on this occasion
in Rome, and how delightful must have been her stay
there. She had now reached the full measure of her
reputation. The religious and doctrinal topics which
were now occupying the best minds in Italy, and
on which her thoughts were frequently busied in
her correspondence with such men as those named
above, had recently begun to form the subject-matter
of her poems. And their superiority in vigour and
earnestness to her earlier works must have been perfectly
apparent to her reverend and learned friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TO FERRARA.</div>

<p>Accordingly we are told that her stay in Rome on
this occasion was a continued ovation; and Signor
Visconti informs us, on the authority of the Neapolitan
historian Gregorio Rosso, that Charles V. being then
in Rome "condescended to visit in their own house
the ladies Giovanna di Aragona, wife of Ascanio
Colonna, and Vittoria Colonna, Marchesa di Pescara."</p>

<p>The following year, 1537 that is, she went, Visconti
says, to Lucca, from which city she passed to Ferrara,
arriving there on the 8th of April "in humble guise,
with six waiting women only."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Ercole d'Este, the
second of the name, was then the reigning duke, having
succeeded to his father Alphonso in 1534. And the
court of Ferrara, which had been for several years preeminent
among the principalities of Italy for its love of
literature and its patronage of literary men, became yet
more notably so in consequence of the marriage of
Hercules II. with Renée of France, the daughter of
Louis XII. The Protestant tendencies and sympathies
of this Princess had rendered Ferrara also the resort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
and in some instances the refuge, of many professors
and favourers of the new ideas which were beginning
to stir the mind of Italy. And though Vittoria's orthodox
Catholic biographers are above all things anxious
to clear her from all suspicion of having ever held
opinions eventually condemned by the Church, there is
every reason to believe that her journey to Ferrara was
prompted by the wish to exchange ideas upon these
subjects with some of those leading minds which were
known to have imbibed Protestant tendencies, if not to
have acquired fully formed Protestant convictions. It
is abundantly clear, from the character of her friendships,
from her correspondence, and from the tone of
her poetry at this period, and during the remainder of
her life, that her mind was absorbingly occupied with
topics of this nature. And the short examination of
the latter division of her works, which it is proposed
to attempt in the next chapter, will probably convince
such as have no partisan Catholic feelings on the subject,
that Vittoria's mind had made very considerable
progress in the Protestant direction.</p>

<p>No reason is assigned for her stay at Lucca.
Visconti, with unusual brevity and dryness, merely
states that she visited that city.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> And it is probable
that he has not been able to discover any documents
directly accounting for the motives of her visit. But
he forbears to mention that the new opinions had
gained so much ground there that that Republic was
very near declaring Protestantism the religion of their
state. After her totally unaccounted-for visit to the
heresy-stricken city, she proceeds to another almost
equally tainted with suspicion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">A REPUBLIC OF LETTERS.</div>

<p>It is no doubt perfectly true that Duke Hercules and
his court received her with every possible distinction
on the score of her poetical celebrity, and deemed his
city honoured by her presence. He invited, we are
told, the most distinguished poets and men of letters
of Venice and Lombardy to meet her at Ferrara.
And so much was her visit prized that when Cardinal
Giberto sent thither his secretary, Francesco della
Torre, to persuade her to visit his episcopal city
Verona, that ambassador wrote to his friend Bembo, at
Venice, that he "had like to have been banished by
the Duke, and stoned by the people for coming there
with the intention of robbing Ferrara of its most
precious treasure, for the purpose of enriching
Verona." Vittoria, however, seems to have held out
some hope that she might be induced to visit Verona.
For the secretary, continuing his letter to the literary
Venetian cardinal, says, "Who knows but what we may
succeed in making reprisal on them? And if that
should come to pass, I should hope to see your Lordship
more frequently in Verona, as I should see Verona the
most honoured as well as the most envied city in Italy."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to have more striking testimony to
the fame our poetess had achieved by her pen; and it
is a feature of the age and clime well worth noting,
that a number of small states, divided by hostilities
and torn by warfare, should have, nevertheless, possessed
among them a republic of letters capable of
conferring a celebrity so cordially acknowledged
throughout the whole extent of Italy.</p>

<p>From a letter<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> written by Vittoria to Giangiorgio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
Trissino of Vicenza, the author of an almost forgotten
epic, entitled "Italia liberata da Goti," bearing date
the 10th of January (1537), we learn that she found the
climate of Ferrara "unfavourable to her indisposition;"
which would seem to imply a continuance of ill-health.
Yet it was at this time that she conceived the idea of
undertaking a journey to the Holy Land.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Her old
pupil, and nearly life-long friend, the Marchese del
Vasto, came from Milan to Ferrara, to dissuade her
from the project. And with this view, as well as to
remove her from the air of Ferrara, he induced her to
return to Rome, where her arrival was again made a
matter of almost public rejoicing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHURCH HOPES.</div>

<p>The date of this journey was probably about the
end of 1537. The society of the Eternal City, especially
of that particular section of it which made the
the world of Vittoria, was in a happy and hopeful
mood. The excellent Contarini had not yet departed<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
thence on his mission of conciliation to the Conference,
which had been arranged with the Protestant leaders
at Ratisbon. The brightest and most cheering hopes
were based on a total misconception of the nature, or
rather on an entire ignorance of the existence of that
under current of social change, which, to the north of
the Alps, made the reformatory movement something
infinitely greater, more fruitful of vast results, and
more inevitable, than any scholastic dispute on points
of theologic doctrine. And at the time of Vittoria's
arrival, that little band of pure, amiable, and high-minded,
but not large-minded men, who fondly hoped
that, by the amendment of some practical abuses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
a mutually forbearing give-and-take arrangement of
some nice questions of metaphysical theology, peace
on earth and good-will among men, might be yet made
compatible with the undiminished pretensions and
theory of an universal and infallible Church, were still
lapped in the happiness of their day-dream. Of this
knot of excellent men, which comprised all that was
best, most amiable, and most learned in Italy, Vittoria
was the disciple, the friend, and the inspired Muse.
The short examination of her religious poetry, therefore,
which will be the subject of the next chapter,
will not only open to us the deepest and most earnest
part of her own mind, but will, in a measure, illustrate
the extent and nature of the Protestantising tendencies
then manifesting themselves in Italy.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The extreme corruption of the Italian church, and
in some degree also the influence of German thought,
had even as early as the Pontificate of Leo X., led
several of the better minds in Italy to desire ardently
some means of religious reform. A contemporary
writer cited by Ranke,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> tells us that in Leo's time
some fifty or sixty earnest and pious men formed themselves
into a society at Rome, which they called the
"Oratory of Divine Love," and strove by example and
preaching to stem as much as in them lay the tide of
profligacy and infidelity. Among these men were
Contarini, the learned and saint-like Venetian, Sadolet,
Giberto, Caraffa (a man, who however earnest in his
piety, showed himself at a later period, when he
became pope as Paul IV., to be animated with a very
different spirit from that of most of his fellow
religionists), Gaetano, Thiene, who was afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
canonised, etc. But in almost every part of Italy,
not less than in Rome, there were men of the same
stamp, who carried the new ideas to greater or lesser
lengths, were the objects of more or less ecclesiastical
censure and persecution; and who died, some reconciled
to, and some excommunicated by the Church
they so vainly strove to amend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JUAN VALDEZ.</div>

<p>In Naples, Juan Valdez, a Spaniard, Secretary to
the Viceroy, warmly embraced the new doctrines; and
being a man much beloved, and of great influence,
he drew many converts to the cause. It was a pupil
and friend of his, whose name it has been vainly
sought to ascertain, who composed the celebrated
treatise, "On the Benefits of the Death of Christ,"
which was circulated in immense numbers over the
whole of Italy, and exercised a very powerful influence.
A little later, when the time of inquisitorial persecution
came, this book was so vigorously proscribed,
sought out and destroyed, that despite the vast number
of copies which must have existed in every corner of
Italy, it has utterly disappeared, and not one is known
to be in existence.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> It is impossible to have a more
striking proof of the violent and searching nature of
the persecution under Paul IV. Another friend of
Valdez, who was also intimate with Vittoria, was
Marco Flaminio, who revised the treatise "On the
Benefits of Christ's Death."</p>

<p>In Modena, the Bishop Morone, the intimate friend
of Pole and Contarini, and his chaplain, Don Girolamo
de Modena, supported and taught the same opinions.</p>

<p>In Venice, Gregorio Cortese, Abbot of San Giorgio
Maggiore, Luigi Priuli, a patrician, and the Benedictine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
Marco, of Padua, formed a society mainly
occupied in discussing the subtle questions which
formed the "symbolum" of the new party.</p>

<p>"If we enquire," says Ranke,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> "what was the faith
which chiefly inspired these men, we shall find that
the main article of it was that same doctrine of justification,
which, as preached by Luther, had given rise
to the whole Protestant movement."</p>

<p>The reader fortunate enough to be wholly unread in
controversial divinity, will yet probably not have escaped
hearing of the utterly interminable disputes on justification,
free-will, election, faith, good works, prevenient
grace, original sin, absolute decrees, and predestination,
which, with much of evil, and as yet little good consequence,
have occupied the most acute intellects, and
most learning-stored brains of Europe for the last
three centuries. Without any accurate knowledge of
the manner in which the doctrines represented by these
familiar terms are dependent on, and necessitated by
each other, and of the precise points on which the
opposing creeds have fought this eternal battle, he will
be aware that the system popularly known as Calvinism,
represents the side of the question taken by the reformers
of the sixteenth century, while the opposite theory of
justification by good works was that held by the orthodox
Catholic Church, or unreforming party. And with
merely these general ideas to guide him, it will appear
strangely unaccountable to find all the best, noblest
and purest minds adopting a system which in its
simplest logical development inevitably leads to the
most debasing demonolatry, and lays the axe to the
root of all morality and noble action; while the corrupt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
the worldly, the ambitious, the unspiritual, the
unintellectual natures that formed the dominant party,
held the opposite opinion apparently so favourable to
virtue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JUSTIFICATION.</div>

<p>An explanation of this phenomenon by a partisan
of either school would probably be long and somewhat
intricate. But the matter becomes intelligible enough,
and the true key to the wishes and conduct of both
parties is found, if, without regarding the moral or
theological results of either scheme, or troubling ourselves
with the subtleties by which either side sought
to meet the objections of the other, we consider simply
the bearings of the new doctrines on that ecclesiastical
system, which the orthodox and dominant party were
determined at all cost to support. If it were admitted
that man is justifiable by faith alone, that his election
is a matter to be certified to his own heart by the
immediate operation of the divine spirit, it would
follow that the whole question of his religious condition
and future hopes might be, or rather must be,
settled between him and his creator alone. And then
what would become of ecclesiastical authority and
priestly interference? If the only knowledge possible
to be attained of any individual's standing before God,
were locked in his own breast, what hold can the
Church have on him? It is absolutely necessary to
any system of spiritual tyranny, that no doctrine should
be admitted by virtue of which a layman may tell a
priest that despite the opinion he, the priest, may form
upon the subject, he, the layman, has the assurance
of acceptation before God, by means of evidence of a
nature inscrutable to the priest. Once admit this,
and the whole foundation of ecclesiastical domination
is sapped. Nay, by a very logical and short route,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
sure to be soon travelled by those who have made good
this first fundamental pretension, they would arrive at
the negation and abolition of all priesthood. Preachers
and teachers might still have place under such a
system, but not priests, or priestly power. To this
an externally ascertainable religion is so vitally necessary,
that the theory of justification by good works
was far from sufficient for the purposes of the Catholic
priesthood, as long as good works could be understood
to mean a general course of not very accurately
measurable virtuous living. This was not sufficient,
because though visible not sufficiently tangible, countable,
and tariffable. Hence the good works most
urgently prescribed, became reduced to that mass of
formal practices so well known as the material of
Romanist piety, among which, the most valuable for
the end in view, are of course those which can only
be performed by the intervention of a priest.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that all this was as
plainly discerned by the combatants in that confused
strife as it may be by lookers back on it from a
vantage ground three centuries high. The innovators
were in all probability few, if any of them, conscious
of the extent and importance of the principle they
were fighting for. And, on the other hand, there is no
reason to attribute an evil consciousness of motives,
such as those nakedly set forth above, to the conservative
party. The fact that a doctrine would tend to
abridge Church power and endanger Church unity,
would doubtless have appeared to many a good and
conscientious man a sufficient proof of its unsoundness
and falsity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER PROTESTANTISM.</div>

<p>Indeed, even among the reformers in Italy the fear
of schism was so great, and the value attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Church unity so high, that these considerations probably
did as much towards checking and finally
extinguishing Protestantism in Italy as did the strong
hand of persecution. From the first, many of the most
earnest advocates of the new doctrines were by no
means prepared to sever themselves from the Church
for the sake of their opinions. Some were ready to
face such schism and martyrdom also in the cause; as,
for instance, Bernardino Ochino, the General of the
Capuchins, and the most powerful preacher of his day,
who fled from Italy and became a professed Protestant,
and Carnesecchi, the Florentine, who was put to death
for his heresy at Rome.</p>

<p>But it had not yet become clear how far the new
doctrines might be held compatibly with perfect community
with the Church of Rome at the time when
Vittoria arrived in that city from Ferrara. The conference
with the German Protestants, by means of
which it was hoped to effect a reconciliation, was then
being arranged, and the hopes of Vittoria's friends ran
high. When these hopes proved delusive, and when
Rome pronounced herself decisively on the doctrines
held by the Italian reformers, the most conspicuous
friends of Vittoria did not quit the Church. She herself
writes ever as its submissive and faithful daughter.
But as to her having held opinions which were afterwards
declared heretical, and for which others suffered,
much of her poetry, written probably about this time,
affords evidence so clear that it is wonderful Tiraboschi
and her biographers can deem it possible to maintain
her orthodoxy.</p>

<p class="b1">Take, for example, the following sonnet:</p>

<p class="psq20">"Quand'io riguardo il nobil raggio ardente<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>Della grazia divina, e quel valore<br />
Ch'illustra 'l intelletto, infiamma il core<br />
Con virtù sopr'umana, alta, e possente,</p>
<p class="psi20">L'alma le voglie allor fisse ed intente<br />
Raccoglie tutte insieme a fargli onore;<br />
Ma tanto ha di poter, quant'è 'l favore<br />
Che dal lume e dal foco intende e sente.</p>
<p class="psi20">Ond ella può ben far certa efficace<br />
L'alta sua elezion, ma insino al segno<br />
Ch'all autor d'ogni ben, sua mercè, piace.</p>
<p class="psi20">Non sprona il corso nostro industria o ingegno;<br />
Quel corre più sicuro e più vivace,<br />
C'ha dal favor del ciel maggior sostegno."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Thus rendered into English blank verse, with a
greater closeness to the sense of the original than
might perhaps have been attained in a translation
hampered by the necessity of rhyming:</p>

<p class="psq20">"When I reflect on that bright noble ray<br />
Of grace divine, and on that mighty power,<br />
Which clears the intellect, inflames the heart<br />
With virtue, strong with more than human strength,</p>
<p class="psi20">My soul then gathers up her will, intent<br />
To render to that Power the honour due;<br />
But only so much can she, as free grace<br />
Gives her to feel and know th'inspiring fire.</p>
<p class="psi20">Thus can the soul her high election make<br />
Fruitful and sure; but only to such point<br />
As, in his goodness, wills the Fount of good.</p>
<p class="psi20">Nor art nor industry can speed her course;<br />
He most securely and alertly runs<br />
Who most by Heaven's free favour is upheld."</p>

<p class="p1">The leading points of Calvinistic doctrine could
hardly be in the limits of a sonnet more clearly and
comprehensively stated. Devotional meditation inclines
the heart to God; but the soul is powerless even to
worship, except in such measure as she is enabled to
do so by freely-given grace. By this means only can
man make sure his election. To strive after virtue is
useless to the non-elect, seeing that man can safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
run his course only in proportion as he has received
the favour of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEVOTIONAL SONNET.</div>

<p class="b1">Again, in the following sonnet will be remarked a
tone of thought and style of phrase perfectly congenial
to modern devotional feeling of what is termed the
evangelical school; while it is assuredly not such
as would meet the approval of orthodox members
of either the Roman Catholic or Anglo-Catholic
churches:</p>

<p class="psq20">"Quando dal lume, il cui vivo splendore<br />
Rende il petto fedel lieto e sicuro,<br />
Si dissolve per grazia il ghiaccio duro,<br />
Che sovente si gela intorno al core,</p>
<p class="psi20">Sento ai bei lampi del possente ardore<br />
Cader delle mie colpe il manto oscuro,<br />
E vestirmi in quel punto il chiaro e puro<br />
Della prima innocenza e primo amore.</p>
<p class="psi20">E sebben con serrata e fida chiave<br />
Serro quel raggio; egli è scivo e sottile,<br />
Si ch'un basso pensier lo scaccia e sdegna.</p>
<p class="psi20">Ond'ei ratto sen vola; io mesta e grave<br />
Rimango, e 'l prego che d'ogni ombra vile<br />
Mi spogli, acciò più presto a me sen vegna."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Which may be thus, with tolerable accuracy, rendered
into English:</p>

<p class="psi20">"When by the light, whose living ray both peace<br />
And joy to faithful bosoms doth impart,<br />
The indurated ice, around the heart<br />
So often gather'd, is dissolved through grace,</p>
<p class="psi20">Beneath that blessed radiance from above<br />
Falls from me the dark mantle of my sin;<br />
Sudden I stand forth pure and radiant in<br />
The garb of primal innocence and love.</p>
<p class="psi20">And though I strive with lock and trusty key<br />
To keep that ray, so subtle 'tis and coy,<br />
By one low thought 'tis scared and put to flight.</p>
<p class="psi20">So flies it from me. I in sorrowing plight<br />
Remain, and pray, that he from base alloy<br />
May purge me, so the light come sooner back to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Here, in addition to the "points of doctrine" laid
down in the previous sonnet, we have that of sudden
and instantaneous conversion and sanctification; and
that without any aid from sacrament, altar, or priest.</p>

<p class="b1">Similar thoughts are again expressed in the next
sonnet selected, which in Signor Visconti's edition
immediately follows the preceding:</p>

<p class="psq20">"Spiego per voi, mia luce, indarno l'ale,<br />
Prima che 'l caldo vostro interno vento<br />
M'apra l'ere d'ntorno, ora ch'io sento<br />
Vincer da nuovo ardir l'antico male;</p>
<p class="psi20">Chè giunga all'infinito opra mortale<br />
Opra vostra è, Signor, che in un momento<br />
La può far degna; ch'io da me pavento<br />
Di cader col pensier quand'ei più sale.</p>
<p class="psi20">Bramo quell'invisibil chiaro lume,<br />
Che fuga densa nebbia; e quell'accesa<br />
Secreta fiamma, ch'ogni gel consuma.</p>
<p class="psi20">Onde poi, sgombra dal terren costume,<br />
Tutta al divino amor l'anima intesa<br />
Si mova al volo altero in altra piuma."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Thus done into English:</p>

<p class="psq20">"Feeling new force to conquer primal sin,<br />
Yet all in vain I spread my wings to thee,<br />
My light, until the air around shall be<br />
Made clear for me by thy warm breath within.</p>
<p class="psi20">That mortal works should reach the infinite<br />
Is thy work, Lord! For in a moment thou<br />
Canst give them worth. Left to myself I know<br />
My thought would fall, when at its utmost height.</p>
<p class="psi20">I long for that clear radiance from above<br />
That puts to flight all cloud; and that bright flame<br />
Which secret burning warms the frozen soul;</p>
<p class="psi20">So that set free from every mortal aim,<br />
And all intent alone on heavenly love,<br />
She flies with stronger pinion t'wards her goal."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE CONFESSIONAL.</div>

<p class="p1 b1">In the following lines, which form the conclusion of
a sonnet, in which she has been saying that God does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
not permit that any pure heart should be concealed from
His all-seeing eye "by the fraud or force of others,"
we have a very remarkable bit of such heresy on the
vital point of the confessional, as has been sufficient to
consign more than one victim to the stake:</p>

<p class="psq20">"Securi del suo dolce e giusto impero,<br />
Non come il primo padre e la sua donna,<br />
Dobbiam del nostro error biasimare altrui;</p>
<p class="psi20">Ma con la speme accesa e dolor vero<br />
Aprir dentro, <i>passando oltra la gonna<br />
I falli nostri a solo a sol con lui</i>".</p>

<p class="p1 b1">The underlined words, "passando oltra la gonna,"
literally, "passing beyond the gown," though the sense
appears to be unmistakable, are yet sufficiently obscure
and unobvious, and the phrase sufficiently far-fetched,
to lead to the suspicion of a wish on the part of the
writer in some degree to veil her meaning. "That in
the captain's but a choleric word, which in the soldier
is foul blasphemy." And the high-born Colonna lady,
the intimate friend of cardinals and princes, might
write much with impunity which would have been
perilous to less lofty heads. But the sentiment in
this very remarkable passage implies an attack on one
of Rome's tenderest and sorest points. In English
the lines run thus:</p>

<p class="psq20">"Confiding in His just and gentle sway<br />
We should not dare, like Adam and his wife,<br />
On other's backs our proper blame to lay;</p>
<p class="psi20">But with new-kindled hope and unfeigned grief,<br />
<i>Passing by priestly robes, lay bare within<br />
To him alone the secret of our sin</i>."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Again, in the conclusion of another sonnet, in which
she has been speaking of the benefits of Christ's death,
and of the necessity of a "soprannatural divina fede"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
for the receiving of them, she writes in language very
similar to that of many a modern advocate of "free
inspiration," and which must have been distasteful to
the erudite clergy of the dominant hierarchy, as
follow:</p>

<p class="psq20">"Que' ch'avrà sol in lui le luci fisse,<br />
Non que' ch'intese meglio, o che più lesse<br />
Volumi in terra, in ciel sarà beato.</p>
<p class="psi20">In carta questa legge non si scrisse;<br />
Ma con la stampa sua nel cor purgato<br />
Col foco dell'amor Gesù l'impresse."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">In English:</p>

<p class="psq20">"He who hath fixed on Christ alone his eyes,<br />
Not he who best hath understood, or read<br />
Most earthly volumes, shall Heaven's bliss attain.</p>
<p class="psi20">For not on paper did He write His law,<br />
But printed it on expurgated hearts<br />
Stamped with the fire of Jesus' holy love."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">In another remarkable sonnet, she gives expression
to the prevailing feeling of the pressing necessity for
Church reform, joined to a marked declaration of belief
in the doctrine of Papal infallibility; a doctrine, which
by its tenacious hold on the Italian mind, contributed
mainly to extinguish the sudden straw-blaze of reforming
tendencies throughout Italy. The lines run as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"Veggio d'alga e di fango omai sì carca,<br />
Pietro, la rete tua, che se qualche onda<br />
Di fuor l'assale o intorno circonda,<br />
Potria spezzarsi, e a rischio andar la barca;</p>
<p class="psi20">La qual, non come suol leggiera e scarca,<br />
Sovra 'l turbato mar corre a seconda,<br />
Ma in poppa e 'n prora, all'una e all'altra sponda<br />
E' grave sì ch'a gran periglio varca.</p>
<p class="psi20">Il tuo buon successor, <i>ch'alta cagione<br />
Direttamente elesse</i>, e cor e mano<br />
Move sovente per condurla a porto.</p>
<p class="psi20"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>Ma contra il voler suo ratto s'oppone<br />
L'altrui malizia; onde ciascun s'è accorto,<br />
Ch'egli senza 'l tuo aiuto adopra in vano."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Which may be thus read in English blank verse,
giving not very poetically, but with tolerable fidelity,
the sense of the original:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"With mud and weedy growth so foul I see<br />
Thy net, O Peter, that should any wave<br />
Assail it from without or trouble it,<br />
It might be rended, and so risk the ship.</p>
<p class="psi20">For now thy bark, no more, as erst, skims light<br />
With favoring breezes o'er the troubled sea;<br />
But labours burthen'd so from stem to stern,<br />
That danger menaces the course it steers.</p>
<p class="psi20">Thy good successor, <i>by direct decree<br />
Of providence elect</i>, with heart and hand<br />
Assiduous strives to bring it to the port.</p>
<p class="psi20">But spite his striving his intent is foiled<br />
By other's evil. So that all have seen<br />
That without aid from thee, he strives in vain."</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAPAL PRETENSIONS DEAR TO ITALIANS.</div>

<p class="p1">The lofty pretensions of the Bishop of Rome, which
our poetess, with all her reforming aspirations, goes
out of her way to declare and maintain in the phrase
of the above sonnet marked by Italics, were dear to the
hearts of Italians. It may be, that an antagonistic
bias, arising from feelings equally beyond the limits of
the religious question, helped to add acrimony to the
attacks of the transalpine reformers. But there can
be no doubt, that Italian self-love was active in rendering
distasteful to Italians a doctrine, whose effect
would be to pull down Rome from her position as
capital of the Christian world, and no longer permit an
Italian eclesiastic to issue his lofty decrees "Urbi et
Orbi." And those best acquainted with the Italian
mind of that period, as evidenced by its literature, and
illustrated by its still-existing tendencies and prejudices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
will most appreciate the extent to which such
feelings unquestionably operated in preventing the reformation
from taking root, and bearing fruit in Italy.</p>

<p>The readers of the foregoing sonnets, even those who
are familiar with the language of the original, will
probably have wondered at the greatness of the poetical
reputation, which was built out of such materials. It
is but fair, however, to the poetess to state, that the
citations have been selected, rather with the view of
decisively proving these Protestant leanings of Vittoria,
which have been so eagerly denied, and of illustrating
the tone of Italian Protestant feeling at that period,
than of presenting the most favourable specimens of
her poetry. However fitly devotional feeling may be
clothed in poetry of the highest order, controversial
divinity is not a happy subject for verse. And Vittoria,
on the comparatively rare occasions, when she permits
herself to escape from the consideration of disputed
dogma, can make a nearer approach to true poetry of
thought and expression.</p>

<p class="b1">In the following sonnet, it is curious to observe how
the expression of the grand and simple sentiment of
perfect trust in the will and intentions of the omnipotent
Creator, which, in the first eight lines, rises into
something like poetry, becomes flattened and debased
into the most prosaic doggrel, as soon as the author,
recollecting the controversies raging round her on the
subject, bethinks her of the necessity of duly defining
the theological virtue of "Faith," as being of that
sort fit for the production of works.</p>

<p class="psq20">"Deh! mandi oggi, Signor, novello e chiaro<br />
Raggio al mio cor di quella ardente fede,<br />
Ch'opra sol per amor, non per mercede,<br />
Onde ugualmente il tuo voler gli è caro!</p>
<p class="psi20"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>Dal dolce fonte tuo pensa che amaro<br />
Nascer non possa, anzi riceve e crede<br />
Per buon quant'ode, e per bel quanto vede,<br />
Per largo il ciel, quand'ei si mostra avaro.</p>
<p class="psi20">Se chieder grazia all'umil servo lice,<br />
Questa fede vorrei, che illustra, accende,<br />
E pasce l'alma sol di lume vero.</p>
<p class="psi20">Con questa in parte il gran valor s'intende,<br />
Che pianta e ferma in noi l'alta radice,<br />
Qual rende i frutti a lui tutti d'amore."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Which may be thus rendered:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"Grant to my heart a pure fresh ray, O Lord,<br />
Of that bright ardent faith, which makes thy will<br />
Its best-loved law, and seeks it to fulfil<br />
For love alone, not looking for reward;&mdash;</p>
<p class="psi20">That faith, which deems no ill can come from thee,<br />
But humbly trusts, that, rightly understood<br />
All that meets eye or ear is fair and good,<br />
And Heaven's love oft in prayers refused can see.</p>
<p class="psi20">And if thy handmaid might prefer a suit,<br />
I would that faith possess that fires the heart,<br />
And feeds the soul with the true light alone;</p>
<p class="psi20">I mean hereby, that mighty power in part,<br />
Which plants and strengthens in us the deep root,<br />
From which all fruits of love for him are grown."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEOLOGICAL SONNETS.</div>

<p class="p1 b1">In the following sonnet, which is one of several
dictated by the same mood of feeling, the more subjective
tone of her thought affords us an autobiographical
glimpse of her state of mind on religious subjects.
We find, that the new tenets which she had
imbibed had failed to give her peace of mind. That
comfortable security, and undoubting satisfied tranquillity,
procured for the mass of her orthodox contemporaries,
by the due performance of their fasts,
vigils, penitences, &amp;c., was not attained for Vittoria by
a creed, which required her, as she here tells us, to
stifle the suggestions of her reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p class="psq20">"Se con l'armi celesti avess'io vinto<br />
Me stessa, i sensi, e la ragione umana,<br />

Dal mondo, e dal suo onor falso dipinto.</p>
<p class="psi20">Sull'ali della fede il pensier cinto<br />
Di speme, omai non più caduca e vana,<br />
Sarebbe fuor di questa valle insana<br />
Da verace virtute alzato e spinto.</p>
<p class="psi20">Ben ho già, fermo l'occhio al miglior fine<br />
Dei nostro corso; ma non volo ancora<br />
Per lo destro sentier salda e leggiera.</p>
<p class="psi20">Veggio i segni del sol, scorgo l'aurora;<br />
Ma per li sacri giri alle divine<br />
Stanze non entro in quella luce vera."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Englished as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">
"Had I with heavenly arms 'gainst self and sense<br />
And human reason waged successful war,<br />
Then with a different spirit soaring far<br />
I'd fly the world's vain glory and pretence.</p>
<p class="psi20">Then soaring thought on wings of faith might rise<br />
Armed by a hope no longer vain or frail<br />
Far from the madness of this earthly vale,<br />
Led by true virtue towards its native skies.</p>
<p class="psi20">That better aim is ever in my sight,<br />
Of man's existence; but not yet 'tis mine<br />
To speed sure-footed on the happy way.</p>
<p class="psi20">Signs of the rising sun and coming day<br />
I see; but enter not the courts divine<br />
Whose holy portals lead to perfect light."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">A touch of similar feeling may be observed also in
the following sonnet, united with more of poetical
feeling and expression. Indeed, this sonnet may be
offered as a specimen of the author's happiest
efforts.&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"Fra gelo e nebbia corro a Dio sovente<br />
Per foco e lume, onde i ghiacci disciolti<br />
Sieno, e gli ombrosi veli aperti e tolti<br />

<p class="p1 b1">If the reader, who is able to form a judgment of the
poetical merit of this sonnet only from the subjoined
translation, should fail to find in it anything to justify
the opinion that has been expressed of it, he is entreated
to believe that the fault is that of the translator,
who can promise only that the sense has been faithfully
rendered:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"Ofttimes to God through frost and cloud I go<br />
For light and warmth to break my icy chain,<br />
And pierce and rend my veils of doubt in twain<br />
With his divinest love, and radiant glow.</p>
<p class="psi20">And if my soul sit cold and dark below<br />
Yet all her longings fixed on heaven remain;<br />
And seems she 'mid deep silence to a strain<br />
To listen, which the soul alone can know,&mdash;</p>
<p class="psi20">Saying, Fear nought! for Jesus came on earth,&mdash;<br />
Jesus of endless joys the wide deep sea,<br />
To ease each heavy load of mortal birth.</p>
<p class="psi20">His waters ever clearest, sweetest be<br />
To him, who in a lonely bark drifts forth,<br />
On his great deeps of goodness trustfully."</p>

<p class="p1">It will probably be admitted, that the foregoing
extracts from Vittoria Colonna's poetry, if they do not
suffice to give the outline of the entire fabric of her
religious faith, yet abundantly prove, that she must be
classed among the Protestant and reforming party of
her age and country, rather than among the orthodox
Catholics, their opponents. The passages quoted all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
bear, more or less directly, on a few special points of
doctrine, as do also the great bulk of her religious
poems. But these points are precisely those on which
the reforming movement was based, the cardinal points
of difference between the parties. They involve exactly
those doctrines which Rome, on mature examination
and reflection, rightly found to be fatally incompatible
with her system. For the dominant party at Trent were
assuredly wiser in their generation than such children
of light, as the good Contarini, who dreamed that a
purified Papacy was possible, and that Rome might
still be Rome, after its creed had been thus modified.
Caraffa and Ghislieri, Popes Paul IV. and Pius V., and
their inquisitors knew very clearly better.</p>

<p>It is, of course, natural enough, that the points of
doctrine then new and disputed, the points respecting
which the poetess differed from the majority of the
world around her, and which must have been the
subject of her special meditation, should occupy also
the most prominent position in her writings. Yet it is
remarkable, that in so large a mass of poetry on exclusively
religious themes, there should be found hardly
a thought or sentiment on topics of practical morality.
The title of "<i>Rime sacre e morali</i>," prefixed by
Visconti to this portion of Vittoria's writings, is
wholly a misnomer. If these sonnets furnish the materials
for forming a tolerably accurate notion of her
scheme of theology, our estimate of her views of morality
must be sought elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BAD MORALITY.</div>

<p>There is every reason to feel satisfied, both from
such records as we have of her life, and from the
perfectly agreeing testimony of her contemporaries,
that the tenour of her own life and conduct was not
only blameless, but marked by the consistent exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
of many noble virtues. But, much as we hear from
the lamentations of preachers of the habitual tendency
of human conduct to fall short of human professions, the
opposite phenomena exhibited by men, whose intuitive
moral sense is superior to the teaching derivable from
their creed, is perhaps quite as common. That band
of eminent men, who were especially known as the
maintainers and defenders of the peculiar tenets held
by Vittoria, were unquestionably in all respects the
best and noblest of their age and country. Yet their
creed was assuredly an immoral one. And in the rare
passages of our poetess's writings, in which a glimpse
of moral theory can be discerned, the low and unenlightened
nature of it is such, as to prove, that the
heaven-taught heart reached purer heights than the
creed-taught intelligence could attain.</p>

<p>What could be worse, for instance, than the morality
of the following conclusion of a sonnet, in which she
has been lamenting the blindness of those who sacrifice
eternal bliss for the sake of worldly pleasures.</p>

<p class="b1">She writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"Poichè 'l mal per natura non gli annoia,<br />
E del ben per ragion piacer non hanno,<br />
Abbian almen di Dio giusto timore."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">In English:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psq20">"Since evil by its nature pains them not,<br />
Nor good for its own proper sake delights,<br />
Let them at least have righteous fear of God."</p>

<p class="p1">She appears incapable of understanding, that no fear
of God could in any wise avail to improve or profit
him, who has no aversion from evil, and no love for
good. She does not perceive, that to inculcate so godless
a fear of God, is to make the Creator a mere bugbear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
for police purposes; and that a theory of Deity
constructed on this basis would become a degrading
demonolatry!</p>

<p>Vittoria Colonna has survived in men's memory as a
poetess. But she is far more interesting to the historical
student, who would obtain a full understanding of
that wonderful sixteenth century, as a Protestant. Her
highly gifted and richly cultivated intelligence, her
great social position, and above all, her close intimacy
with the eminent men who strove to set on foot an
Italian reformation which should not be incompatible
with the Papacy, make the illustration of her religious
opinions a matter of no slight historical interest. And
the bulk of the citations from her works has accordingly
been selected with this view. But it is fair to
her reputation to give one sonnet at least, chosen for
no other reason than its merit.</p>

<p class="b1">The following, written apparently on the anniversary
of our Saviour's crucifixion, is certainly one of the
best, if not the best in the collection:</p>

<p class="psq20">"Gli angeli eletti al gran bene infinito<br />
Braman oggi soffrir penosa morte,<br />
Acciò nella celeste empirea corte<br />
Non sia più il servo, che il signor, gradito.</p>
<p class="psi20">Piange l'antica madre il gusto ardito<br />
Ch'a' figli suoi del ciel chiuse le porte;<br />
E che due man piagate or sieno scorte<br />
Da ridurne al cammin per lei smarrito.</p>
<p class="psi20">Asconde il sol la sua fulgente chioma;<br />
Spezzansi i sassi vivi; apronsi i monti;<br />
Trema la terra e 'l ciel; turbansi l'acque;</p>
<p class="psi20">Piangon gli spirti, al nostro mal si pronti,<br />
Delle catene lor l'aggiunta soma.<br />
L'uomo non piange, e pur piangendo nacque!"</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Of which the following is an inadequate but tolerably
faithful translation:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p class="psq20">"The angels to eternal bliss preferred,<br />
Long on this day a painful death to die,<br />
Lest in the heavenly mansions of the sky<br />
The servant be more favoured than his Lord.</p>
<p class="psi20">Man's ancient mother weeps the deed, this day<br />
That shut the gates of heaven against her race,<br />
Weeps the two piercèd hands, whose work of grace,<br />
Refinds the path, from which she made man stray.</p>
<p class="psi20">The sun his ever-burning ray doth veil;<br />
Earth and sky tremble; ocean quakes amain,<br />
And mountains gape, and living rocks are torn.</p>
<p class="psi20">The fiends, on watch for human evil, wail<br />
The added weight of their restraining chain.<br />
Man only weeps not; yet was weeping born."</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNCERTAINTY OF ORTHODOXY.</div>

<p class="p1">As the previous extracts from the works of Vittoria
have been, as has been stated, selected principally with
a view to prove her Protestantism, it is fair to observe,
that there are several sonnets addressed to the Virgin
Mary, and some to various Saints, from which (though
they are wholly free from any allusion to the grosser
superstitions that Rome encourages her faithful disciples
to connect with these personages), it is yet clear
that the writer believed in the value of saintly intercession
at the throne of grace. It is also worth remarking,
that she nowhere betrays the smallest consciousness
that she is differing in opinion from the recognised
tenets of the Church, unless it be found, as was before
suggested, in an occasional obscurity of phrase, which
seems open to the suspicion of having been intentional.
The great majority of these poems, however, were in all
probability composed before the Church had entered
on her new career of persecution. And as regards the
ever-recurring leading point of "justification by grace,"
it was impossible to say exactly how far it was orthodox
to go in the statement of this tenet, until Rome had
finally decided her doctrine by the decrees of the
Council of Trent.</p>

<p>One other remark, which will hardly fail to suggest
itself to the modern reader of Vittoria's poetry, may be
added respecting these once celebrated and enthusiastically
received works. There is not to be discovered
throughout the whole of them one spark of Italian, or
patriotic feeling. The absence of any such, must,
undoubtedly, be regarded only as a confirmation of the
fact asserted in a previous chapter, that no sentiment
of the kind was then known in Italy. In that earlier
portion of her works, which is occupied almost exclusively
with her husband's praises, it is hardly possible
that the expression of such feelings should have found
no place, had they existed in her mind. But it is a
curious instance of the degree to which even the better
intellects of an age are blinded by, and made subservient
to, the tone of feeling and habits of thought prevalent
around them, that it never occurs to this pure
and lofty-minded Vittoria, in celebrating the prowess of
her hero, to give a thought to the cause for which he
was drawing the sword. To prevail, to be the stronger,
"to take great cities," "to rout the foe," appears to
be all that her beau ideal of heroism required.</p>

<p>Wrong is done, and the strong-handed doer of it
admired, the moral sense is blunted by the cowardly
worship of success, and might takes from right the
suffrages of the feeble, in the nineteenth as in the
sixteenth century. But the contemplation of the total
absence from such a mind as that of Vittoria Colonna,
of all recognition of a right and a wrong in such matters,
furnishes highly instructive evidence of the reality
of the moral progress mankind has achieved.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Vittoria arrived in Rome from Ferrara in all probability
about the end of the year 1537. She was
now in the zenith of her reputation. The learned and
elegant Bembo<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> writes of her, that he considered her
poetical judgment as sound and authoritative as that of
the greatest masters of the art of song. Guidiccioni, the
poetical Bishop of Fossombrone, and one of Paul III.'s
ablest diplomatists, declares<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> that the ancient glory
of Tuscany had altogether passed into Latium in her
person; and sends her sonnets of his own, with
earnest entreaties that she will point out the faults of
them. Veronica Gambara, herself a poetess, of merit
perhaps not inferior to that of Vittoria, professed herself
her most ardent admirer, and engaged Rinaldo Corso
to write the commentary on her poems, which he
executed as we have seen. Bernardo Tasso made her
the subject of several of his poems. Giovio dedicated
to her his life of Pescara, and Cardinal Pompeo
Colonna his book on "The Praises of Women;" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Contarini paid her the far more remarkable compliment
of dedicating to her his work "On Free Will."</p>

<p>Paul III. was, as Muratori says,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> by no means well
disposed towards the Colonna family. Yet Vittoria must
have had influence with the haughty and severe old
Farnese. For both Bembo, and Fregoso, the Bishop
of Naples, have taken occasion to acknowledge that
they owed their promotion to the purple in great
measure to her.</p>

<p>But the most noteworthy event of this period of
Vittoria's life, was the commencement of her acquaintance
with Michael Angelo Buonarroti.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> That great
man was then in his 63rd year, while the poetess was
in her 47th. The acquaintanceship grew rapidly into
a close and durable friendship, which lasted during
the remainder of Vittoria's life. It was a friendship
eminently honourable to both of them. Michael
Angelo was a man whose influence on his age was felt
and acknowledged, while he was yet living and
exercising it, to a degree rarely observable even in the
case of the greatest minds. He had, at the time in
question, already reached the zenith of his fame,
although he lived to witness and enjoy it for another
quarter of a century. He was a man formed by
nature, and already habituated by the social position
his contemporaries had accorded to him, to mould
men&mdash;not to be moulded by them&mdash;not a smooth or
pliable man; rugged rather, self-relying, self-concentrated,
and, though full of kindness for those who
needed kindness, almost a stern man; no courtier,
though accustomed to the society of courts; and apt
to consider courtier-like courtesies and habitudes as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
impertinent impediments to the requirements of his
high calling, to be repressed rather than condescended
to. Yet the strong and kingly nature of this high-souled
old man was moulded into new form by contact
with that of the comparatively youthful poetess.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRIENDSHIP WITH MICHAEL ANGELO.</div>

<p>The religious portion of the great artist's nature
had scarcely shaped out for itself any more defined
and substantial form of expression than a worship of
the beautiful in spirit as well as in matter. By Vittoria
he was made a devout Christian. The change is
strongly marked in his poetry; and in several passages
of the poems, four or five in number, addressed to her,
he attributes it entirely to her influence.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Some silly stuff has been written by very silly
writers, by way of imparting the "interesting" character
of a <i>belle passion</i>, more or less platonic, to
this friendship between the sexagenarian artist and
the immaculate Colonna. No argument is necessary
to indicate the utter absurdity of an idea which
implies a thorough ignorance of the persons in question,
of the circumstances of their friendship, and of
all that remains on record of what passed between
them. Mr. Harford, whose "Life of Michael Angelo"
has been already quoted, was permitted, he says, to
hear read the letters from Vittoria to her friend, which
are preserved in that collection of papers and memorials
of the great artist, which forms the most treasured
possession of his descendants;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and he gives the
following account of them:<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>"They are five in number; and there is a sixth,
addressed by her to a friend, which relates to Michael
Angelo. Two of these letters refer in very grateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
terms to the fine drawings he had been making for her,
and to which she alludes with admiration. Another
glances with deep interest at the devout sentiments of
a sonnet, which it appears he had sent for her perusal....
Another tells him in playful terms that his
duties as architect of St. Peter's, and her own to the
youthful inmates of the convent of St. Catherine at
Viterbo, admit not of their frequently exchanging
letters. This must have been written just a year
before her death, which occurred in 1547. Michael
Angelo became architect of St. Peter's in 1546. These
letters are written with the most perfect ease, in a firm,
strong hand; but there is not a syllable in any of
them approaching to tenderness."</p>

<p>The period of Vittoria's stay in Rome on this occasion
must have been a pleasant one. The acknowledged
leader of the best and most intellectual society
in that city; surrounded by a company of gifted and
high-minded men, bound to her and to each other by
that most intimate and ennobling of all ties, the
common profession of a higher, nobler, purer theory
of life than that which prevailed around them, and a
common membership of what might almost be called
a select church within a church, whose principles and
teaching its disciples hoped to see rapidly spreading
and beneficially triumphant; dividing her time between
her religious duties, her literary occupations, and conversation
with well-loved and well-understood friends;&mdash;Vittoria
can hardly have been still tormented by
temptations to commit suicide. Yet in a medal struck
in her honour at this period of her life, the last of the
series engraved for Visconti's edition of her works, the
reverse represents a ph&oelig;nix on her funeral pile gazing
on the sun, while the flames are rising around her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
The obverse has a bust of the poetess, showing the
features a good deal changed in the course of the six
or seven years which had elapsed since the execution
of that silly Pyramus and Thisbe medal mentioned in
a previous chapter, though still regular and well
formed. The tendency to fatness and to a comfortable-looking
double chin is considerably increased. She
wears a singularly unbecoming head-dress of plaited
linen, sitting close to and covering the entire head,
with long pendants at the sides falling over the
shoulders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COLONNA AT WAR.</div>

<p>These pleasant Roman days were, however, destined
to be of brief duration. They were cut short, strange
as the statement may seem, by the imposition of an
increased tax upon salt. For when Paul III. resorted,
in 1539, to that always odious and cruel means of
pillaging his people, Ascanio Colonna maintained that,
by virtue of some ancient privilege, the new tax could
not be levied on his estates. The pontifical tax-gatherers
imprisoned certain of his vassals for refusing
to pay; whereupon Ascanio assembled his retainers,
made a raid into the Campagna, and drove off a large
number of cattle.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The Pope lost no time in gathering
an army of ten thousand men, and "war was declared"
between the sovereign and the Colonna. The varying
fortunes of this "war" have been narrated in detail by
more than one historian.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Much mischief was done,
and a great deal of misery occasioned by both the contending
parties. But at length the forces of the
Sovereign got the better of those of his vassal, and the
principal fortresses of the Colonna were taken, and
their fortifications ordered to be razed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in consequence of these misfortunes, and of
that remarkable "solidarity" which, as has been before
observed, united in those days the members of a family
in their fortunes and reverses, that Vittoria quitted
Rome, probably towards the end of 1540, and retired
to Orvieto. But the loss of their brightest ornament
was a misfortune which the higher circles of Roman
society could not submit to patiently. Many of the
most influential personages at Paul III.'s court visited
the celebrated exile at Orvieto, and succeeded ere long
in obtaining her return to Rome after a very short
absence.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> And we accordingly find her again in the
eternal city in the August of 1541.</p>

<p>There is a letter written by Luca Contile,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> the
Sienese historian, dramatist and poet, in which he
speaks of a visit he had paid to Vittoria in Rome in
that month. She asked him, he writes, for news of Fra
Bernardino (Ochino), and on his replying that he had
left behind him at Milan the highest reputation for
virtue and holiness, she answered, "God grant that he
so persevere!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOULD NEVER QUIT THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>On this passage of Luca Contile's letter, Visconti
and others have built a long argument in proof of
Vittoria's orthodoxy. It is quite clear, they say, that
she already suspected and lamented Ochino's progress
towards heresy, and thus indicates her own aversion to
aught that might lead to separation from the church of
Rome. It would be difficult, however, to show that
the simple phrase in question had necessarily any such
meaning. But any dispute on this point is altogether
nugatory; for it may be at once admitted that Vittoria
did not quit, and in all probability would not under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
any circumstances have quitted, the communion of
the Church. And if this is all that her Romanist
biographers wish to maintain, they unquestionably are
correct in their statements. She acted in this respect
in conformity with the conduct of the majority of
those eminent men whose disciple and friend she was
during so many years. And the final extinction of
the reformatory movement in Italy was in great
measure due precisely to the fact that conformity to
Rome was dearer to most Italian minds than the independent
assertion of their own opinions. It may be
freely granted that there is every reason to suppose
that it would have been so to Vittoria, had she not
been so fortunate as to die before her peculiar tenets
were so definitively condemned as to make it necessary
for her to choose between abandoning them or abandoning
Rome. But surely all the interest which
belongs to the question of her religious opinions consists
in the fact that she, like the majority of the best
minds of her country and age, assuredly held doctrines
which Rome discovered and declared to be incompatible
with her creed.</p>

<p>A more agreeable record of Vittoria's presence in
Rome at this time, and an interesting glimpse of the
manner in which many of her hours were passed, is to be
found in the papers left by one Francesco d'Olanda,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
a Portuguese painter, who was then in the eternal city.
He had been introduced, he tells us, by the kindness of
Messer Lattanzio Tolemei of Siena to the Marchesa de
Pescara, and also to Michael Angelo; and he has
recorded at length several conversations between these
and two or three other members of their society in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
which he took part. The object of his notes appears
to have been chiefly to preserve the opinions expressed
by the great Florentine on subjects connected with the
arts. And it must be admitted, that the conversation
of the eminent personages mentioned, as recorded by
the Portuguese painter, appears, if judged by the standard
of nineteenth century notions, to have been
wonderfully dull and flat.</p>

<p>The record is a very curious one even in this point
of view. It is interesting to measure the distance
between what was considered first-rate conversation in
1540, and what would be tolerated among intelligent
people in 1850. The good-old-times admirers, who
would have us believe that the ponderous erudition of
past generations is distasteful to us, only by reason of
the touch-and-go butterfly frivolousness of the modern
mind, are in error. The long discourses which charmed a
sixteenth century audience, are to us intolerably boring,
because they are filled with platitudes;&mdash;with facts,
inferences, and speculations, that is, which have passed
and repassed through the popular mind, till they have
assumed the appearance of self-evident truths and fundamental
axioms, which it is loss of time to spend
words on. And time has so wonderfully risen in value!
And though there are more than ever men whose discourse
might be instructive and profitable to their associates,
the universality of the habit of reading prevents
conversation from being turned into a lecture. Those
who have matter worth communicating, can do so more
effectually and to a larger audience by means of the
pen; and those willing to be instructed, can make
themselves masters of the thoughts of others far more
satisfactorily by the medium of a book.</p>

<p>But the external circumstances of these conversations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
noted down for us by Francesco d'Olanda, give
us an amusing peep into the literary life of the Roman
world three hundred years ago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVERSATION IN 1540.</div>

<p>It was one Sunday afternoon that the Portuguese
artist went to call on Messer Lattanzio Tolemei, nephew
of the cardinal of that name. The servants told him,
that their master was in the church of San Silvestro,
at Monte Cavallo, in company with the Marchesa di
Pescara, for the purpose of hearing a lecture on the
Epistles of St. Paul, from a certain Friar Ambrose of
Siena. Maestro Francesco lost no time in following
his friend thither. And "as soon as the reading and
the interpretations of it were over," the Marchesa
turning to the stranger, and inviting him to sit beside
her, said; "If I am not mistaken, Francesco d'Olanda
would better like to hear Michael Angelo preach on
painting, than to listen to Friar Ambrose's lecture."</p>

<p>Whereupon the painter, "feeling himself piqued,"
assures the lady that he can take interest in other matters
than painting, and that however willingly he would
listen to Michael Angelo on art, he would prefer to hear
Friar Ambrose when St. Paul's epistles were in question.</p>

<p>"Do not be angry, Messer Francesco," said Signor
Lattanzio, thereupon. "The Marchesa is far from
doubting that the man capable of painting may be
capable of aught else. We, in Italy, have too high an
estimate of art for that. But, perhaps, we should gather
from the remark of the Signora Marchesa the intention
of adding to the pleasure you have already had, that of
hearing Michael Angelo."</p>

<p>"In that case, said I, her Excellence would do only
as is her wont;&mdash;that is, to accord greater favours than
one would have dared to ask of her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>So Vittoria calls to a servant, and bids him go to the
house of Michael Angelo, and tell him, "that I and
Messer Lattanzio are here in this cool chapel, that the
church is shut, and very pleasant, and ask him if he
will come and spend a part of the day with us, that we
may put it to profit in his company. But do not tell
him that Francesco d'Olanda the Spaniard is here."</p>

<p>Then there is some very mild raillery about how
Michael Angelo was to be led to speak of painting;&mdash;it
being, it seems, very questionable whether he could
be induced to do so; and a little bickering follows
between Maestro Francesco and Friar Ambrose, who
feels convinced that Michael will not be got to talk
before the Portuguese, while the latter boasts of his
intimacy with the great man.</p>

<p>Presently there is a knock at the church door. It
is Michael Angelo, who has been met by the servant as
he was going towards the baths, talking with Orbino,
his colour-grinder.</p>

<p>"The Marchesa rose to receive him, and remained
standing a good while, before making him sit down
between her and Messer Lattanzio." Then, "with an
art, which I can neither describe nor imitate, she began
to talk of various matters with infinite wit and grace,
without ever touching the subject of painting, the better
to make sure of the great painter."</p>

<p>"One is sure enough," she says at last, "to be completely
beaten, as often as one ventures to attack
Michael Angelo on his own ground, which is that of
wit and raillery. You will see, Messer Lattanzio, that
to put him down and reduce him to silence, we must
talk to him of briefs, law processes, or painting."</p>

<p>By which subtle and deep-laid plot the great man is
set off into a long discourse on painters and painting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">IN THE CHURCH OF SAN SILVESTRO.</div>

<p>"His Holiness," said the Marchesa, after a while,
"has granted me the favour of authorising me to build
a new convent, near this spot, on the slope of Monte
Cavallo, where there is the ruined portico, from the top
of which, it is said, that Nero looked on while Rome
was burning; so that virtuous women may efface the
trace of so wicked a man. I do not know, Michael
Angelo, what form or proportions to give the building,
or on which side to make the entrance. Would it not
be possible to join together some parts of the ancient
constructions, and make them available towards the
new building?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Michael Angelo; "the ruined portico
might serve for a bell-tower."</p>

<p>This repartee, says our Portuguese reporter, was
uttered with so much seriousness and <i>aplomb</i>, that
Messer Lattanzio could not forbear from remarking
it.</p>

<p>From which we are led to infer, that the great
Michael was understood to have made a joke. He
added, however, more seriously; "I think, that your
Excellence may build the proposed convent without
difficulty; and when we go out, we can, if your Excellence
so please, have a look at the spot, and suggest
to you some ideas."</p>

<p>Then, after a complimentary speech from Vittoria, in
which she declares that the public, who know Michael
Angelo's works only without being acquainted with his
character, are ignorant of the best part of him, the
lecture, to which all this is introductory begins. And
when the company part at its close, an appointment is
made to meet again another Sunday in the same
church.</p>

<p>A painter in search of an unhackneyed subject might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
easily choose a worse one than that suggested by this
notable group, making the cool and quiet church their
Sunday afternoon drawing-room.</p>

<p>The few remaining years of Vittoria's life were spent
between Rome and Viterbo, an episcopal city some
thirty miles to the north of it. In this latter her home
was in the convent of the nuns of St. Catherine. Her
society there consisted chiefly of Cardinal Pole, the
governor of Viterbo, her old friend Marco Antonio
Flaminio, and Archbishop Soranzo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER LETTER TO CERVINO.</div>

<p class="b1">During these years the rapidly increasing consciousness
on the part of the Church of the danger
of the doctrines held by the reforming party, was
speedily making it unsafe to profess those opinions,
which, as we have seen, gave the colour to so large a
portion of Vittoria's poetry, and which had formed
her spiritual character. And these friends, in the
closest intimacy with whom she lived at Viterbo, were
not the sort of men calculated to support her in any
daring reliance on the dictates of her own soul, when
these chanced to be in opposition to the views of the
Church. Pole appears to have been at this time the
special director of her conscience. And we know but
too well, from the lamentable sequel of his own career,
the sort of counsel he would be likely to give her under
the circumstances. There is an extremely interesting
letter extant, written by her from Viterbo to the
Cardinal Cervino, who was afterwards Pope Marcellus
II., which proves clearly enough, to the great
delight of her orthodox admirers, that let her opinions
have been what they might, she was ready to "submit"
them to the censureship of Rome. We have seen
how closely her opinions agreed with those which
drove Bernardino Ochino to separate himself from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
Church, and fly from its vengeance. Yet under Pole's
tutelage she writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq">"Most Illustrious and most Reverend Sir,</p>

<p class="pbq">"The more opportunity I have had of observing
the actions of his Eminence the Cardinal of
England (Pole), the more clear has it seemed to me
that he is a true and sincere servant of God. Whenever,
therefore, he charitably condescends to give me
his opinion on any point, I conceive myself safe from
error in following his advice. And he told me that, in
his opinion, I ought, in case any letter or other matter
should reach me from Fra Bernardino, to send the
same to your most Reverend Lordship, and return no
answer, unless I should be directed to do so. I send
you therefore the enclosed, which I have this day
received, together with the little book attached. The
whole was in a packet, which came to the post here by
a courier from Bologna, without any other writing
inside. And I have thought it best not to make use
of any other means of sending it, than by a servant
of my own." * * *</p>

<p class="p1 b1">She adds in a postscript:</p>

<p class="pbq">"It grieves me much that the more he tries to excuse
himself the more he accuses himself; and the more
he thinks to save others from shipwreck, the more he
exposes himself to the flood, being himself out of the
ark which saves and secures."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Poor Ochino little thought probably that his letter
to his former admiring and fervent disciple, would be
passed on with such a remark to the hands of his
enemies! He ought, however, to have been aware
that princesses and cardinals, whatever speculations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
they may have indulged in, do not easily become
heretics.</p>

<p>She returned once more from Viterbo to Rome towards
the end of the year 1544, and took up her residence
in the convent of Benedictines of St Anne. While
there she composed the latin prayer, printed in the
note,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> which has been much admired, and which, though
not so Ciceronian in its diction as Bembo might have
written, will bear comparison with similar compositions
by many more celebrated persons. Several of the
latest of her poems were also written at this time.
But her health began to fail so rapidly as to give great
uneasiness to her friends. Several letters are extant
from Tolomei to her physician, anxiously inquiring
after her health, urging him to neglect no resources
of his art, and bidding him remember that "the lives
of many, who continually receive from her their food&mdash;some
that of the body, and others that of the mind&mdash;are
bound up in hers."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> The celebrated physician
and poet Fracastoro, was written to in Verona. In
his reply, after suggesting medical remedies, he
says, "Would that a physician for her mind could be
found! Otherwise the fairest light in this world
will, from causes by no means clear (<i>a non so che
strano modo</i>) be extinguished and taken from our
eyes."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>The medical opinion of Fracastoro, writing from a
distance, may not be of much value. But it is certain
that many circumstances combined to render these
declining years of Vittoria's life unhappy. The fortunes
of her family were under a cloud; and it is
probable that she was as much grieved by her brother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
conduct, as by the consequences of it. The death
also of the Marchese del Vasto, in the flower of his
age, about this time, was a severe blow to her. Ever
since those happy early days in Ischia, when she had
been to him, as she said, morally and intellectually a
mother, the closest ties of affection had united them;
and his loss was to Vittoria like that of a son. Then
again, though she had perfectly made up her mind as
to the line of conduct it behoved her to take in regard
to any difficulties of religious opinion, yet it cannot be
doubted that the necessity of separating herself from
so many whom she had loved and venerated, deserting
them, as it were, in their falling fortunes, must have
been acutely painful to her. Possibly also conscience
was not wholly at rest with her on this matter. It
may be that the still voice of inward conviction would
sometimes make obstinate murmur against blindfold
submission to a priesthood, who ought not, according
to the once expressed opinion of the poetess, to come
between the creature and his creator.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HER LAST HOURS.</div>

<p>As she became gradually worse and weaker, she was
removed from the convent of St. Anne, to the neighbouring
house of Giuliano Cesarini, the husband of
Giulia Colonna, the only one of her kindred then left
in Rome. And there she breathed her last towards
the end of February, 1547, in the 57th year of her age.</p>

<p>In her last hours she was visited by her faithful
and devotedly attached friend Michael Angelo, who
watched the departure of the spirit from her frame;
and who declared,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> years afterwards, that he had never
ceased to regret that in that solemn moment he had
not ventured to press his lips for the first and last
time, to the marble forehead of the dead.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>
<p>She had directed that her funeral should be in all
respects like that of one of the sisters of the convent
in which she last resided. And so completely were
her behests attended to, that no memorial of any kind
remains to tell the place of her sepulture.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">ORIGINAL TEXT OF CATHERINE'S LETTER
TO THE KING OF FRANCE.</p>

<hr class="dec3" />

<p class="pn center p2">LETTERA 187.</p>

<p class="pn p1">Carissimo padre in Cristo dolce Jesù. Io Catarina, schiava de'
servi di Jesù Cristo, scrivo a voi nel prezioso sangue suo, con desiderio
di vedere in voi uno vero e perfettissimo lume, acciò che
cognosciate le verità di quello che v'è necessario per la vostra
salute. Senza questo lume andaremmo in tenebre, la qual tenebre
non lascia discernere quello che ci è nocivo all'anima e al corpo,
e quello che ci è utile; e per questo guasta il gusto dell'anima,
che le cose buone le fanno parer cattive e le cattive buone, cioè il
vizio; e quelle cose che ci conducono a peccato, ci pajono buone e
dilettevoli; e le virtù e quello che ci induce alla virtù ci pajono
amare e di grande malagevolezza: ma chi ha lume cognosce bene
la verità: e però ama la virtù, e Dio, che è la cagione di ogni
virtù, ed odia il vizio e la propria sensualità, che è cagione d'ogni
vizio. Chi ci tolle questo vero e dolce lume? L'amor proprio
che l'uomo ha a sè medesimo, il quale è una nuvola che offusca
l'occhio dell'intelletto e ricopre la pupilla del lume della santissima
fede; e però va come cieco ed ignorante seguitando la
fragilità sua, tutto passionato senza lume di ragione, si come
animale che, perchè non ha ragione, si lassa guidare al proprio
sentimento. Grande miseria e dell'uomo, il quale Dio ha creato
all'imagine e similitudine sua, che egli voluntariamente per suo
difetto si facci peggio che animale bruto, come ingrato ed ignorante
non cognosce, nè ricognosce li benefizj da Dio, ma ritribuisceli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
a sè medesimo. Dall'amor proprio procede ogni male. Unde
vengono le ingiustizie e tutti gli altri difetti? dall'amore proprio.
Egli commette ingiustizia contra Dio, contra sè e contra al prossimo
suo, e contra la santa Chiesa. Contra Dio la commette, che
non rende gloria e loda al nome suo come egli è obbligato; a sè
non rende odio e dispiacimento del vizio, ed amore delle virtù; nè
al prossimo la benivolenza; e se egli è signore non gli tiene
giustizia, perchè non la fa se non secondo il piacere delle creature
o per proprio suo piacere umano. Nè alla Chiesa rende l'obbedienzia
e non la sovviene, ma continuamente la perseguita: di
tutto è cagione l'amor proprio, che non il lassa cognoscere la
Verità, perchè è privato del lume. Questo ci è molto manifesto,
e tutto dì il vediamo e proviamo in noi medesimi, che egli
è così.</p>

<p>Non vorrei, carrissimo padre, che questa nuvola vi tollesse il
lume; ma voglio che in voi sia quel lume che vi faccia cognoscere
e discernere la Verità. Parmi secondo che io intendo, che cominciate
a lassarvi guidare al consiglio de' tenebrosi, e voi sapete, che
se l'uno cieco guida l'altro, ambidue caggiono nella fossa. Così
diverrà a voi, se voi non ci ponete altro remedio che quello che io
sento. Honne grande ammirazione che uomo cattolico che voglià
temere Dio ed esser virile, si lassi guidare come fanciullo, e che
non vegga come metta sè e altrui in tanta ruina, quanta è di
contaminare il lume della santissima fede per consiglio e detto di
coloro che noi vediamo esser membri del demonio, arbori corrotti,
dei quali ci sono manifesti i diffetti loro per l'ultimo veleno che
hanno seminato della eresia: dicendo che papa Urbano VI. non
sia veramente papa. Aprite l'occhio dell'intelletto, e riguardate
che essi mentono sopra il capo loro, per loro medesimi si possono
confondere, e veggonsi degni di grande supplicio da qualunque
lato noi ci volliamo. Se noi ci volliamo a quelli che essi dicono,
che l'elessero per paura della furia del populo, essi non dicono la
verità, perocchè prima l'avevano eletto con elezione canonica ed
ordinata sì come fosse eletto mai verun altro sommo pontifice.
Essi si spacciarono ben di fare la elezione per lo timore che il
populo no si levasse, ma non che per timore elli non elegessero
misser Bartolomeo arcivescovo di Bari, il quale è oggi papa Urbano
VI., e così confesso in verità, e non lo niego. Quello che essi
elessero per paura, ciò fu missere di Santo Pietro, apparbe
evidente a ciascuno, ma la elezione di papa Urbano era fatta ordinamente<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
come detto è. Questo annunziarono a voi e a noi, ed
agli altri signori del mondo, manifestando per opera quello che
ci dicevano con parole, cioè facendoli riverenzia, adorandolo come
Cristo in terra, e coronandolo con tanta solennità; rifacendo di
nuovo l'elezione con grande concordia: a lui come sommo pontifice
chiesero le grazie, ed usaronle; e se non fusse stato vero, che
papa Urbano fusse papa, ma che lo avessoro eletto per paura, e
non sarebbero essi degni eternalmente di confusione? Che le
colonne della santa Chiesa poste per dilatare la fede, per timore
della morte corporale volessero dare a loro ed a noi morte eternale?
Mostrando ci per padre quello che non fussi? E non sarebbero essi
ladri, tollendo ed usando quello, che non potessero usare? Sì
ben; se vero fusse quello che ora dicono che non è, anco è veramente
papa Urbano VI., ma come stolti e matti accecati dal
proprio amore, hanno mostrata e data a noi questa verità, e per
loro tengono la bugia: tanto la confessarono questa verità, quanto la
Santità sua indugiò a voler correggere i vizi loro: ma come egli
cominciò a monderli ed a mostrare, che lo scellerato viver loro
li era spiacevole e che egli voleva ponervi il rimedio, subito
levarono il capo. E contra chi l'hanno levato? contra la santa
fede. Fatto hanno peggio che cristiani rinnegati.</p>

<p>O miseri uomini! Essi non cognosceno la loro ruina, nè chi gli
sequita, che se la cognoscessero, essi chiederebbero l'adiutorio
divino; ricognoscerebbero le colpe loro, e non sarebbero ostinati
come dimonia, che drittamente pajono dimonj, e preso hanno
l'ufficio loro. L'ufficio delle dimonia è di pervertire l'anime da
Cristo crocifisso, sottrarle dalla via della verità, e inducierle alla
bugia e recarle a sè, che è padre delle bugie per pena e per supplicio,
dando a loro, quello che egli ha per sè. Così questi vanno
sovvertendo la verità, la quel verità essi medesimi ci hanno data, e
riducendo alla bugia, hanno messo tutto il mondo in divisione; e di
quel male che essi hanno in loro, di quello porgono a noi. Voliamo
noi ben conoscere questa verità? Or ragguardiamo e consideriamo
la vita e costumi loro, e che sèquito essi hanno pure di loro
medesimi, che seguitano le vestigie delle iniquità, perocchè l'uno
dimonio non è contrario all'altro, anco s'accordano insieme. E
perdonatemi, carissimo padre: padre vi terrò in quanto io vi
vegga amatore della verità e confonditore della bugia: perchè io
dico così, perochè 'l dolore della dannazione loro e d'altrui me
n'è cagione, e l'amore ch'io porto alla salute loro. Questo non<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
dico in dispregio loro in quanto creature, ma in dispregio del vizio
e dell'eresia che esci hanno seminata per tutto il mondo, e della
crudeltà che essi usano a loro e all'anime tapinelle che per loro
periscono; delle quali li converrà render ragione dinanzi al sommo
giudice: che se fussero stati uomini che avessero temuto Dio o la
vergogna del mondo, se Dio non volevano temere: se papa Urbano
gli avessi fatto il peggio, che egli l'avesse potuto fare, e maggiore
vituperio averebbe pazientemente portato ed eletto innanzi mille
morti, che fare quello che hanno fatto, che a maggior vergogna e
danno non possono venire, che apparire agli occhi delle creature
scismatici ed eretici contaminatori della santa fede. Se io veggi
il danno dell'anima e del corpo, si mostrano per l'eresia privati
di Dio per grazia, e corporalmente privati della dignità loro di
ragione, ed essi medesimi l'hanno fatto. Se io ragguardo il divino
giudizio, elli si vede presso a loro, se non si levano di questa
tenebre, perocchè ogni colpa è punita e ogni bene è rimunerato.
Duro li sarà a ricalcitrare a Dio, se tutto lo sforzo umano avessero.
Dio è somma fortezza che fortifica i debili che ci confidano e sperano
in lui. Ed è verità. E la verità è quella cosa che ci delibera. Noi
vediamo, che solo la verità de' servi di Dio seguitano e tengono
questa verità di papa Urbano VI., confessandolo veramente papa,
come egli è; non trovarete un servo di Dio che tenga il contrario,
che sia servo di Dio; non dico di quelli che portono di fuore il
vestimento della pecora, e dentro sono lupi rapaci. E credete voi,
che se questa non fusse verità che Dio sostenesse, che i servi suoi
andassero in tanta tenebre? Non il sosterrebbe. Se egli il
sostiene all'iniqui uomini del mondo, non sostiene a loro, e però
l'ha dato lume di questa verità, perchè non è spregiatore de' santi
desiderj, anco ne è accettatore come padre benigno e pietoso che
gli è. Questi vorrei che voi chiamaste a voi, a farvi dichiarare di
questa verità, e non voliate andare sì ignorantemente. Non vi
muova la passione propria che ella sarà peggio a voi che a persona.
Abbiate compassione a tante anime, quante mettete nelle mani
delle dimonia. Se non volete fare il bene, almeno non fate male,
ch'el male spessi volte torna più sopra colui che'l fa, che sopra
colui a chi vuole essere fatto; tanto male n'esce, che ne perdiamo
Dio per grazia, consumansi e beni temporali, e seguitane la morte
degli uomini. Doimè! e non par che noi vediamo lume, che la
nuvola dell'amor propio ci ha tolto il lume, e non ci lassa vedere;
per questo siamo atti a recevere ogni male informazione che ci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
fusse data contra la verità dagli amatori di loro medesimi: ma se
averemo il lume non sarà così ma con grande prudenzia e timore
santo di Dio, vorrete cognoscere ed investigare questa verità per
uomini di conscienzia e di scienzia. Se voi vorrete, in voi non
cadrà ignoranzia, perchè avete costà la fontana della scienzia, la
quale temo che non perdiate, se voi terrete questi modi, e sapete
bene come ne starà il reame vostro, se saranno uomini di buona
coscienzia, che non vogliono seguitare il piacere umano con timore
servile, ma la verità; essi vi dichiareranno e porranno in pace la
mente e l'anima vostra. Or non più così, carissimo padre, recatevi
la mente al petto, pensate che voi dovete morire e non sapete
quando; ponetevi dinanzi all'occhio dell'intelletto Dio e la
verità sua, e non la passione nè l'amore della patria, che quanto a
Dio non doviamo fare differenzia più d'uno che d'un altro,
perchè tutti siamo esciti dalla sua santa mente, creati all'imagine
e similitudine sua, e ricomprati nel prezioza sangue dell'unigenito
suo Figliuolo. So' certa, che se averete il lume voi il farete, e
non aspetterete il tempo, perchè il tempo non aspetta voi, ed
invitarete loro a tornare alla santa e vera obbedienzia, ma altrimenti
no. E però dissi che io desideraro di vedere in voi un vero
e perfettissimo lume, acciocchè col lume cognosciate, amiate e
temiate la verità. Sarà allora beata l'anima mia per la salute
vostra, di vedervi escire di tanto errore. Altro non vi dico.
Permanete nella santa e dolce dilezioni di Dio. Perdonatemi, se
troppo v' ho gravato di parole. L'amore della vostra salute mi
costrigne a più tosto dirvele a bocca con la presenzia che per
scritta. Dio vi riempia della sua dolcissima grazia. Jesù dolce,
Jesù amore.</p>

<p class="pn center lmid">NOTE TO LIFE OF CATHERINE OF SIENA.</p>

<p class="pn center p1">Note 1.&mdash;<a href="#Page_5">Page 5.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">Although I have, since writing the passage in the text, been convinced
by the letter of Dr. H. C. Barlow in the <i>Athenæum</i> of July the
3rd, 1858, that the Fontebranda at Siena was not alluded to by Dante
in the well-known passage referred to, yet as the error, in which I
shared, is so general, that every "Dantescan pilgrim" <i>does</i>, as stated in
the text, hurry to visit the Sienese fountain, solely for the sake of that
one line of the great poet, I have not thought it necessary to alter the
passage; contenting myself with providing against further propagation
of the mistake by this note. I have again visited Romena in the Casentino,
since reading Dr. Barlow's convincing letter; and have no doubt
whatever, that Adam the coiner, was thinking of the well-remembered
waters of the Casentino, the scene of his crime,&mdash;a locality with which
the poet also was, as we know, familiar,&mdash;and not of the distant and
<i>nihil-ad-rem</i> Siena fountain; which will henceforth be deposed from its
Dantescan honours by the verdict of all save Sienese students of the
Inferno. These Dr. Barlow must not expect to convince.</p>

<p class="pn p1">MS. <i>Priorista</i> of Buoudelmonte. This important chronicle, forming
a very large folio volume, is the property of Signore Pietro Bigazzi,
Secretary of the Academia della Crusca; a gentleman, whose accurate
and extensive knowledge of Italian history is as remarkable as the
liberality with which he is ever ready to put the stores of his erudition
at the service of students.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">2.&mdash;<a href="#Page_106">Page 106.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">The diarist Stefano Infessura, in his valuable chronicle of the events
which occurred at Rome from <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1294 to <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1494, the latter years
of which period are recorded with great and most amusing detail, says
that the viands on the occasion of this memorable festival were gilt!
He especially notes that sugar was lavishly used: a special indication
of reckless extravagance.</p>

<p>In recording another equally magnificent festival given by the Cardinal
to Leonora, daughter of King Ferrante, who passed through Rome
on her way northwards to be married to the Duke of Ferrara, Infessura
tells us that this Franciscan mendicant turned Cardinal caused the
bedchamber of the princess and those of all the ladies of her court to
be furnished with certain implements of a kind generally deemed more
useful than ornamental, made of gold! "Oh! guarda," cries the historian,
as he well might, "in quale cosa bisogna che si adoperi lo tesauro
della Chiesa!" <i>Rer. Ital. Script.</i> Tom III. Pars. II. p. 1144.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">3.&mdash;<a href="#Page_108">Page 108.</a></p>

<p class="pn">Some discrepancies in the accounts of these transactions and the
dates of them in the contemporary historians have led Burriel into
supposing that the Cardinal Riario made two journeys to Milan, the
first in 1472, and the second in 1473, and that on both occasions he
arrived there on the 12th of September. The first journey however
is, as far as I can find from a careful examination of the authorities,
wholly imaginary. The difficulty seems to have been, that Corio represents
Girolamo Riario, the proposed bridegroom, to have been invested
with the County of Imola on the 6th of November, 1472. And it is
difficult to suppose that this could have been done before all the conditions
of the marriage were finally arranged, which they certainly were
not till after the Cardinal's journey to Milan. But Corio is a very
untrustworthy guide as far as dates are concerned. Another blunder
of his in the very passage, in which he tells of Imola having been
given to Girolamo Riario as Catherine's dower, might have put Burriel
on his guard. When the marriage was determined on, he says, the
Duke "gave her Imola for her dower.... After that&mdash;<i>dipoi</i>&mdash;on
the 20th of August, Borso of Este, Marquis of Ferrara, died." Now
that prince died on the 27th of May, 1471.</p>

<p>Muratori (ad ann. 1473), quoting Platina assigns the true date of
1473 to Girolamo's investiture of the County of Imola; but supposed
that that principality was purchased by the Cardinal of the Manfredi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
family for forty thousand ducats, and given by him to his brother.
But as to this point of the story Burriel must be considered to be correct.
For he says, that the conditions of the marriage, including the
giving Imola as the bride's dower, "are proved by Catherine's last
Will and Testament, which we have before us, and by Filippo of Bergamo
in his life of the Count, and by Andrea Bernardi in his chronicle,
both of whom were contemporary writers." The notion of the sum of
forty thousand ducats having been paid by the Riarios for Imola seems
to have arisen from the fact, that that sum was by the marriage contract
stipulated to be paid down by the Pope.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>It is remarkable that the two most notable historians of Milan in
recent times, Verri and Rosmini, are both wholly silent as to the marriage
of Catherine, the negociations with the Cardinal Riario on that
subject, and the acquisition of Imola.</p>

<p>Count Pietro Verri died in 1797, leaving his History of Milan incomplete.
It has been often reprinted, and has been always highly esteemed
by his fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>The four bulky and handsome 4to. volumes of the Cavaliere Carlo
de' Rosmini on the History of Milan were printed in 1820; and have
taken the rank of a standard work.</p>

<p>Bernardino Corio, "gentleman of Milan," was one of Duke Maria
Galeazzo's pages and chamberlains; and in that part of his history,
therefore, which touches our subject, is an eye-witness of what he
relates. Should any reader have the curiosity to refer to the amusing
pages of this old writer, he must take care to look at the edition printed
at Padua, in one vol. 4to, 1646. That printed at Venice in the same
form about half a century earlier is grossly incomplete. For instance,
the whole of the interesting description of the Duke's gorgeous cavalcade,
from which the text is taken, is omitted in the Venice edition.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">4.&mdash;<a href="#Page_115">Page 115.</a></p>

<p class="pn b1">The original text of this Roman lampoon is given here from Corio,
that the classical reader may see more specifically what were the vices
attributed to this pillar of the Church, than an English page can venture
to catalogue them.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">5.&mdash;<a href="#Page_120">Page 120.</a></p>

<p class="pn">A curious example of the audacious cynicism of this Milanese
despot&mdash;and, to be just, we must add, to a great degree, of the time
in which he lived&mdash;is to be found in certain documents of that period
printed by Rossini in the appendices to his history. The following
condition, which we must be permitted to leave in its original Latin,
is found in a deed of gift to a lady named Lucia Marliana, wife of
Ambrogio dei Reverti. It was duly and formally executed before a
notary public, and then preserved among the other state papers and
archives of the Duchy.</p>

<p>"Quamquidem donationem," it runs: "Valere volumus ut supra
dummodo prædicta Lucia cum marito suo per carnalem copulam se
non commisceat <i>sine nostra speciali licenciâ in scriptis</i>, nec cum alio
viro rem habeat, exceptâ personâ nostrâ, si forte cum eâ coire aliquando
libuerit. * * * * Speramus tamen ipsam ita victuram et sese
habituram in devotione et hac monitione nostra promerito ab omni
suspicione de concubitu mariti sine nostrâ licenciâ."</p>

<p>Rosmini intimates that it appears that these conditions were duly
observed. Perhaps he means only that we may conclude them to have
been so from the fact that the deed of gift was not disturbed. It was
indeed followed by many others of the most preposterous prodigality,
to such an extent that the Lady Lucia Marliana became one of the
wealthiest individuals in all Lombardy.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">6.&mdash;<a href="#Page_124">Page 124.</a></p>

<p class="pn">The particulars of female costume mentioned in the text are taken
from a very valuable and curious chronicle, printed by Muratori in the
16th vol. of his collection. See <i>Rer. Ital. Scrip. T. 16. p. 50 et seq.</i> It
is the Chronicon Placentinum by Johannes de Mussis, citizen of
Placentia. He is a vehement <i>laudator temporis acti</i>; and laments the
degeneracy and increasing luxury of his day in the well known tone of
the moralists of any age. The passage is so curious that I am tempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
to translate a considerable portion for the amusement of those who
are not likely to seek the original in the vast treasure-house of
Muratori.</p>

<p>"In the good old time," says John de Mussis, "man and wife at supper
eat out of one dish. The use of carved wooden utensils at table was
unknown. One or two cups for drinking served the whole family.
Those who supped at night lighted the table with torches held in the
hand of a boy or servant; for candles of tallow or of wax were not in
use. The men wore cloaks of skin, or of wool, or of hemp. Women
at their marriage wore tunics of hemp. Coarse were then the fashions
both for men and women. Of gold or silver little or none was seen
in the dress. There was no luxury in food. Men of the people eat
fresh meat thrice a-week. Then for dinner they eat herbs and garden
produce, which had been boiled with the meat; and made their supper
of the meat put by for that purpose. The use of wine in the summer
was not general. Men deemed themselves rich with a small amount
of money. Small were the cellars in those days; and the larders no
bigger. Women were content to marry with a small dower, because
their mode of life was excessively frugal. Virgins before their marriage
were content with a hempen tunic, which was called a 'sotana,' (the
modern Italian word for a petticoat) and a linen<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> garment called a
'socca.' Virgins wore no costly head-dresses. Matrons bound their
temples, cheeks, and chin with broad fillets. * * * * Now the old
customs are superseded by many indecorous usages. But especially
for the destruction of souls has parsimony been changed for luxury.
Clothes are seen of exquisite material and workmanship, and ornamented
to excess. We have silver and gold and pearls in cunning
devices; fringes of wonderful breadth, linings of silk varied with
foreign and costly skins. Incitements to gluttony are not wanting.
Foreign wines are drunk. Drinking is almost universal. Sumptuous
dishes are publicly used. Cooks are held in high honour. Every
sort of provocative to gluttony and greed is in request. And avarice
is called into play for the purpose of supplying the means for all this.
Hence come usury, frauds, rapaciousness, robbery, exiles, domestic
broils, unlawful profits, oppression of the innocent, the extermination
of families, and banishment of the rich. We say 'our God is our
belly,' We return to the pomps which we have renounced in our
baptism, and are deserters from God to the devil. And were it not
that the clergy edify us by their pure examples, there would soon be
no limit to our luxury and ambition. * * * * Our ladies wear long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
and large robes of crimson silk velvet, or of cloth of silk, brocaded
with gold, or of cloth of gold, or of simple cloth of silk, of cloth of
scarlet or crimson wool, or other costly cloths. And these cloths of
purple stuff, or of velvet, or of cloth of gold or brocade cost for a
mantle or gown from 25 up to 40 golden florins or ducats. * * * *
And on some of these dresses there are large and deep fringes of gold
around the collar, which encircles the throat, for all the world like
the spiked collar round the neck of a dog. On others there are put
from three to five ounces of pearls, worth ten golden florins an ounce.
And they wear small hoods with large golden fringes, or with rows of
pearls around the said hoods. And they go girt about the waist with
handsome girdles of gilt silver, or of pearls, worth about 25 golden
florins the girdle. Sometimes no girdle is worn. And every lady has
trinkets of gold and precious stones to the value of from 30 to 50
golden florins.</p>

<p>"Some, however, of these dresses are decorous, because they do not
expose the bosom. But they have other indecent dresses, which are
called Ciprians; these are made extremely large towards the feet, and
close-fitting from the waist upwards, with long and large sleeves, like
those described above. They are of similar cost also, and are adorned
with jewels of equal value. And they are ornamented in front, from
the neck to the feet, with bosses of silver-gilt or of pearls. And these
Ciprians have the opening around the neck so large that they show the
bosom, et videtur, quod dictæ mamillæ velint exire de sinu earum.
Which dresses would be magnificent, if they did not expose the bosom,
and if the collar was so decently close that at least the breast should
not be visible to every body. These ladies also wear in their head-dresses
jewels of great price. For instance, some wear coronets of
silver-gilt, or of pure gold, adorned with pearls and precious stones, to
the value of from 70 to 100 golden florins. And others wear '<i>terzollas</i>'
of large pearls, worth from 100 to 125 golden florins. Which '<i>terzollas</i>'
are so called, because they are made of 300 great pearls, and
because they are made and ranged in three tiers. These ladies, too, in
the place of the chaplets of gold or of silk, which they used to wear
twined in the hair of their head, now wear supports for the hair,
'bugulos,' as they are called, which they cover with their hair tied over
the said 'bugulos,' with braiding of silk or of gold, or with silver
braiding covered with pearls."</p>

<p>The chronicler then describes the dress of grave matrons and that of
widows. The fashions of the young men give as much, or more, offence
to the writer as those of the ladies, for reasons, which the curious must
seek in the very plain speaking and exceedingly barbarous Latin of
John de Mussis' own pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p class="b1">One or two other particulars, however, are worth noting. All persons
of both sexes, both in summer and in winter, wear shoes, and sometimes
hose with soles, or shoes having points three inches long beyond
the feet. Ladies and young men wear chains of silver-gilt, or pearls or
coral, around their necks. The said youths&mdash;these exquisites of Placentia,
who have been dust these four hundred years&mdash;used to shave
their beard, and their hair below the ears, wearing it above that line
frizzed and puffed out to as large a circumference as possible. "And
some keep one horse, and some two, and some five, et aliqui nullum
tenent,"&mdash;which naïf-ly lame conclusion puts one in mind of the French
bard's description of Marlborough's funeral cortège:</p>

<p class="ppa10">"L'un portait se cuirasse;&mdash;L'autre son bouclier;<br />
L'un portait son grand sabre;&mdash;L'autre ne portait rien!"</p>

<p class="p1">The Placentian youths, who kept horses, our author goes on to tell
us, kept grooms also, whose wages were twelve golden florins a-year.
Maid-servants had seven golden florins and their food, but not their
clothes.</p>

<p>The citizens, too, we are told, make very good cheer. At festivals,
especially at marriage feasts, they drink good wine, both white and red.
The beginning of the banquet always consists of confections of sugar.
The first course is generally formed of one or two capons, and "on each
trencher a large piece of meat stewed with almonds and sugar, and
spices and other good things." Then boiled meat is served "in magnâ
quantitate;" capons, chickens, pheasants, partridges, hares, wild boars,
kids, and other meat, according to the time of year. After that, tarts
and cakes, with spun sugar on them, are set forth. A copious description
of supper, as distinguished from dinner, follows, in which the
principal peculiarity seems to be the prevalence of various meats in the
form of "gelatine." Supper always ends with fruit,&mdash;written always
"fluges," indicating a mode of pronunciation still common among the
Italian peasantry, who, to the present day, rhyme "molta" to "porta."
After the "fluges" comes the following conclusion, several times
repeated by the methodical old chronicler, in the same words: "Et
post lotis manibus, antequam tabulæ levantur, dant bibere, et confectum
zuchari, et post bibere." In Lent they begin with the same
formulary, minus the hand-washing; then come figs and peeled
almonds; then large fishes, "à la poivrade,"&mdash;"<i>ad piperatum</i>;" then
rice soup with milk of almonds, and sugar and spices, and salted eels.
After these, boiled pike are served with vinegar sauce, or mustard
sauce, or cooked with wine and spices. Then nuts and other fruit; to
end with "Et post lotis manibus," &amp;c., <i>da capo</i>.</p>

<p>It will be observed, that these luxurious citizens of Placenza had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
sea fish to help out their Lenten diet. Communications were too slow
and difficult.</p>

<p>A curious description of household furniture follows, which I am
deterred from giving only by the fear of increasing this already long
note to a wholly unconscionable bulk. The curious will do well to refer
to it. The construction of fire-places in the houses is noted as an
especial sign of increasing luxury. They have linen curtains, too, around
their beds. Many even are so luxuriously magnificent, that they
"faciunt duas ignes, unum in caminata, et alium in coquina. Et multi
tenent bonas confectiones in domibus eorum de zucharo et de melle.
Quæ omnia sunt magnarum expensarum."</p>

<p>These are the causes, concludes this admirer of the good old times,
why dowers must needs be given to daughters of four or five hundred
golden florins and more; which are then all expended by the bridegroom
in dressing the bride, and in nuptial festivities. "And he, who
married the said bride, spends, besides the dower, some hundred of
golden florins in renovating some of the bride's clothes."</p>

<p>And to meet all these expenses, he says, it must needs be that men
seek to make money by unlawful means. Thus are reduced to poverty
many, who strive to do what is incompatible with their means.</p>

<p>All very bad certainly; and though the author does not tell us
whether any of these extravagant fifteenth-century gentry were directors
of Placenza banks, it is probable enough that they were something
of the sort. But then all this was four hundred years ago: and the
world must have grown wiser since then!</p>

<p class="pn center p2">7.&mdash;<a href="#Page_132">Page 132.</a></p>

<p class="pn">I find this characteristic fact stated in a curious and rare volume on
"the History of the Pontificial golden Rose." "La Rosa d'oro Pontificia.
Raconto Storico. 1 Vol. 4to. In Roma, 1681." There is a chronological
index of all the personages and churches to whom the Rose
has been presented, from which I gather that this mark of Apostolic
favour has fallen to the lot of England five times in the course of ages.
The first was given to Henry IV., by Eugenius IV. The second to
Henry VIII., by Leo X. The third to Henry VIII., by Clement VII.
The fourth to Queen Mary, by Julius III. The fifth was sent to Queen
Henrietta, by Urban VIII., with a message to the effect, that "since
that kingdom had fallen from the faith by means of a woman<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> meretriciously
adorned with roses incarnadined by the polluted blood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
Venus, it might now be recalled and restored to the faith by a royal
lady of infinite piety, holily ornamented with this rose grown in the
odoriferous gardens of Holy Church, and watered by dews and streams
of the fructifying blood of martyrs!!"</p>

<p>It is strange that the only individual to whom the golden rose was
ever given a second time, was the most fatal enemy of the Church,
Henry VIII.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">8.&mdash;<a href="#Page_133">Page 133.</a></p>

<p class="pn">Crimson, scarlet, and purple were the favorite colours. Any fabric
dyed with these cost in the proportion of eighteen to twelve for stuffs
of other colours. Ducange ad voc. "Granum;" where he cites Rymer
for the above fact. Granum is the French "cramoisi;" Angl. "crimson;"
but Ducange seems uncertain whether the dye in question
were cochineal, or a vegetable product.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">9.&mdash;<a href="#Page_151">Page 151.</a></p>

<p class="pn">Among the smaller punishments incurred by some of those more or
less implicated in these conspiracies, it is worth noting that one well-to-do
citizen was fined ninety lire, and all his household furniture,
estimated at fifty lire more. This sum may be probably considered
as equivalent to about £20 sterling at the present day, and does not
give a very favourable idea of the amount of domestic comfort existing
among the citizens. Another conspirator was fined an hundred lire,
and "all his rich and precious furniture was confiscated." In this
case the estimated value is not mentioned. But as the amount of the
fine is nearly the same, it is probable that the culprit belonged to
about the same sphere of society.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">10.&mdash;<a href="#Page_159">Page 159.</a></p>

<p class="pn">The classical reader may, if curious in such matters, turn to Muratori's
columns for the strangely cynical, and wholly unreproducible
language, in which Infessura relates the incident. I have written
"classical," which is generally understood to mean Latin or Greek readers.
And a large portion of Infessura's chronicle is written in very barbarous
Latin. But portions, without any apparent reason for the
change, are written in Italian. And the passage in question occurs in
one of those portions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn center p2">11.&mdash;<a href="#Page_190">Page 190.</a></p>

<p class="pn">The narrative in the text follows the statement of Bonoli and
Burriel, which has also all the probabilities of the case to support it.
Other historians represent Catherine herself to have come out on the
ramparts, and to have turned a deaf ear to the piteous entreaties of
her children, that she would give up the fortress, and so save their
lives. Some of these writers also recount a tale, which suited as it is
to the taste of the vulgar for what is striking, coarsely coloured, and
gross, has become the most popularly known incident of Catherine's
career. When threatened with the immediate destruction of her children
before her eyes, she is said to have replied, in terms more
coarse than can be repeated here, that others might come whence those
had come, and to have accompanied the assertion by gestures yet more
undescribable on an English page.</p>

<p>There is every reason to believe that the whole of this story is an invention.
But it is an invention nearly contemporaneous with the events;
and, given as it is by its inventors by no means as a blameable trait in
the heroine's character, but rather as a proof of commendable energy
and vigorous courage, it is curious as an indication of the prevailing
manners and feelings of the period.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">12.&mdash;<a href="#Page_223">Page 223.</a></p>

<p class="pn">"Pantaloons does not probably properly express the meaning of
'calze.'" The chronicler means those elastic-knitted garments of silk
or wool for the lower half of the person, trowsers and stockings in one,
which sat tight to the limb, and the appearance of which is familiar to
the eyes of those acquainted with the pictures of the time, especially
the great festival paintings of the Venetian school.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">13.&mdash;<a href="#Page_264">Page 264.</a></p>

<p class="pn">This very curious and interesting volume is the property of Signore
Pietro Bigazzi, mentioned in a previous note. It was written by
Lucantonio Cuppano, secretary to Catherine's son, Giovanni delle
Bandenere, who assures us that he copied it from the MS. in
Catherine's own hand.</p>

<p class="pn center lmid p2">NOTES TO THE LIFE OF VITTORIA COLONNA.</p>

<p class="pn center p1">1.&mdash;<a href="#Page_293">Page 293.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">Guiliano Passeri, the author of the diary quoted in the text, was an
honest weaver, living by his art at Naples, in the time of Ferdinand
of Spain and Charles V. His work appears to have been composed
wholly for his own satisfaction and amusement. The entire
work is written in the form of a diary. But as the first entry records
the coming of Alphonso I. to Naples, on "this day the 26th February,
1443;" and the last describes the funeral of the Marchese di Pescara,
Vittoria's husband, on the 12th May, 1526, it is difficult to suppose
that these could have been the daily jottings of one and the same
individual, extending over a period of 83 years, although it is <i>possible</i>
that they may have been so. As the work ends quite abruptly, it
seems reasonable to suppose that it was carried on till the death of
the writer. The probability is, that the memorials of the earlier years
are due to another pen. The work is written in Neapolitan dialect,
and concerns itself very little with aught that passed out of Naples.
It has all the marks of being written by an eye-witness of the circumstances
recorded. The accounts especially of all public ceremonies,
gala-doings, etc., are given in great detail, and with all the gusto of a
regular sight-seer. And the book is interesting as a rare specimen of
the writing and ideas of an artisan of the 16th century.</p>

<p>It was printed in a 4to volume at Naples in 1785, and is rather
rare.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">2.&mdash;<a href="#Page_319">Page 319.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">These false ducats gave rise, we are told, to the king's saying, that
his wife had brought him three gifts:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp30">Faciem pictam,<br />
Monetam fictam,</p>

<p class="p1">to which the ungallant and brutal royal husband added another, the
statement of which ending in "strictam," is so grossly coarse, that it
cannot be repeated here, even with the partial veil of its Latin
clothing.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">3.&mdash;<a href="#Page_332">Page 332.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">The translations of the sonnets in the text have been given solely
with the view of enabling those, who do not read Italian, to form some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
idea of the subject-matter and mode of thought of the author, and not
with any hope or pretension of presenting anything that might be
accepted as a tolerable English sonnet. In many instances the
required continuation of the rhyme has not even been attempted. If
it be asked, why then were the translations not given in simple prose,
which would have admitted a yet greater accuracy of literal rendering?&mdash;it
is answered, that a translation so made would be so intolerably bald,
flat, and silly-sounding, that a still more unfavourable conception of
the original would remain in the English reader's mind than that,
which it is hoped may be produced by the more or less poetically
cast translations given. The originals, printed in every instance, will
do justice (if not more) to our poetess in the eyes of those acquainted
with her language, for the specimens chosen may be relied on as being
not unfavourable specimens. And many readers, probably, who might
not take the trouble to understand the original in a language they
imperfectly understand, may yet, by the help of the translation, if
they think it worth while, obtain a tolerable accurate notion of
Vittoria's poetical style.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">4.&mdash;<a href="#Page_379">Page 379.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">When Mr. Harford heard these letters read, the exceedingly valuable
and interesting museum of papers, pictures, drawings, etc. of
Michael Angelo, was the property of his lineal descendant, the late
minister of public instruction in Tuscany. When dying, he bequeathed
this exceedingly important collection to the "Communità," or corporation
of Florence. The Tuscan law requires that the notary who
draws a will, should do so <i>in the presence of the testator</i>. Unfortunately,
on the sick man complaining of the heat of the room, the notary employed
to draw this important instrument, retired, it seems, into the
next room, which, as a door was open between the two chambers, he
conceived was equivalent to being in presence of the testator, as
required by law. It has been decided, however, by the tribunals of
Florence, that the will was thus vitiated, and that the property must
pass to the heirs at law. An appeal still pending (September 1858)
lies to a higher court; but there is every reason to believe that the
original judgment must be confirmed. In the mean time, the papers,
etc., are under the inviolable seal of the law.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">5.&mdash;<a href="#Page_383">Page 383.</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">The MS. of François de Holland, containing the notices of Vittoria
Colonna, given in the text, is to be found translated into French, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
printed in a volume entitled, "Les Arts en Portugal, par le Comte A.
Raczynski. Paris, 1846."</p>

<p>My attention was directed to the notices of Vittoria to be found in
this volume, by a review of M. Deumier's book on our poetess, by
Signor A. Reumont, inserted in the fifth volume of the new series of
the "Archivio Storico Italiano, Firenze, 1857," p. 138.</p>

<p class="pn center p2">6.&mdash;<a href="#Page_390">Page 390.</a></p>

<p>The prayer written by Vittoria Colonna is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn p1">"Da, precor, Domine, ut eâ animi depressione, quæ humilitati meæ
convenit, eâque mentis elatione, quam tua postulat celsitudo, te semper
adorem; ac in timore, quem tua incutit justitia, et in spe, quam tua
clementia permittit, vivam continue, meque tibi uti potentissimo
subjiciam, tanquam sapientissimo disponam, et ad te ut perfectissimum
et optimum convertar. Obsecro, Pater Pientissime, ut me ignis tuus
vivacissimus depuret, lux tua clarissima illustret, et amor tuus ille
sincerissimus ita proficiat ut ad te nullo mortalium rerum obice
detenta, felix redeam et secura."</p>

saint was of the party of Clement, afterwards definitively judged
by the Church to have been an anti-Pope. Burlamacchi is sadly
gravelled by this awkward fact, and labours hard in his note on the
passage to show that the saints of Clement's party were not warm

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
